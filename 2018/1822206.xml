<AbstractNarration>Energy sustainability represents one of the grand challenges facing modern society, and solar power provides an important source of renewable energy. Photovoltaics (PVs), or solar cells, are solid-state semiconductor devices that convert sunlight directly to electricity.  The vision and long-term goal of the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC) for Next Generation Photovoltaics (NGPV) is to help establish PV electricity as a major source of energy in the United States and the world.  NGPV consists of research sites at The University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin, lead site), Colorado State University (CSU) and Texas A&amp;M University (College Station and Central Texas; TAMU).  Phase II of NGPV has continued to focus on the rapidly evolving research and development needs of the PV industry to include PV device materials, manufacturing and design, and the variety of important soft cost issues such as balance of systems, device maintenance and operation, deployment, policy and education. NGPV research focuses on the rapidly evolving research and development needs of the PV industry, including PV device materials, manufacturing and design, and the variety of important soft cost issues such as balance of systems, device maintenance and operation, deployment, policy and education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The total global PV capacity is anticipated to reach 10 TW by 2030, which corresponds to about 5% of the anticipated global energy consumption. To reach PV deployment of this magnitude, the total cost of PV systems must be reduced while simultaneously increasing energy conversion efficiency, reliability and lifetime.  The capacity to cost-effectively manufacture solar cells and balance of systems components must be significantly increased, and methods to integrate PV into the utility grid must continue to improve to ensure affordable and reliable electricity.  NGPV research at the UT Austin site is being carried out to address these key technological challenges, as well as emerging areas of PVs, as in portable power for internet-things systems, wearable devices, and electric vehicles.  The UT Austin site is also carrying out research on PV energy storage, developing new educational activities to foster societal appreciation and understanding of emerging PV technological capability, and exposing K-5 teachers to PVs.  NGPV encourages interaction and communication across disciplines and between academic researchers and industry partners to catalyze economic growth and create a diverse, highly trained workforce for the PV industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

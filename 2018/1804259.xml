<AbstractNarration>This award enables the Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences (CBMS) to promote, advertise, and provide support services for the conference series known as the NSF/CBMS Regional Research Conferences in Mathematics. These conferences, together with the online and print materials that arise from them, spur research in all areas of the mathematical sciences while attracting young researchers into new, highly-active research areas. The conferences are typically held at institutions that provide opportunities for a broad range of researchers to engage or re-engage with important current research. Many of the hosting departments are in Minority Serving Institutions, providing an opportunity for students from underrepresented groups to experience what it means to participate in the study of advanced mathematical science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through this award, CBMS works to identify the leading scholars in emerging fields who can help to shape the next generation of researchers, as well as the venues where such conferences can have the greatest impact, especially in attracting and supporting researchers from underrepresented minorities. CBMS assists in the preparation of proposals to host conferences, advertises the conferences, assesses their impact, and disseminates the online and print products of the conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>ACM MobiSys is part of a series of annual conferences sponsored by ACM SIGMOBILE. The research and development  results reported in MobiSys conferences span multiple disciplines, including wireless networks and communication, mobile sensing and crowd sourcing applications, wearable computing, vehicular and robotic  wireless systems, operating systems, distributed algorithms, data management, energy management, sensors, security and  privacy. MobiSys seeks to provide a cross-disciplinary venue for researchers addressing the design of mobile computing in the context of an integrated system. In addition to the regular conference program, MobiSys 2018 will include a set of technical workshops, research demonstrations, and a poster session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests funds to support US-based graduate students to attend ACM MobiSys 2018 to be held in Munich, Germany, on June 10 - 15, 2018. The travel grant will enable meritorious students to take advantage of this gathering and interact with the top researchers in the field of mobile systems. Through conference participation, students will be able to identify and/or sharpen their career goals during discussions with experts in the field and also with their peers. While selecting award recipients, the award selection committee will emphasize participation of under-represented groups (women and minorities) and first time attendees with no accepted papers at the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

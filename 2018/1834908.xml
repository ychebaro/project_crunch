<AbstractNarration>This award provides travel support for undergraduate student participation in the Laser Science XXXIV Conference.  This conference is the annual meeting of the APS Division of Laser Science (DLS), and will be held in conjunction with the annual meeting of the Optical Society of America.  The conference program includes many of the research topics central to Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics.  The support of students through this award makes a substantial contribution to the education and training of future scientists. Students who graduate with a background in laser science acquire a broad range of knowledge and skills that enable them to contribute to progress in many areas of science and technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting is scheduled to be held Washington DC September 16-20, 2018.  It offers an opportunity for undergraduate students to present their research results and to interact with senior scientists primarily from the United States, but also the broader international community. Support is provided only for US students (students enrolled in US universities).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

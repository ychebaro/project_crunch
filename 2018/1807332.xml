<AbstractNarration>This project supports the 7th Foundations of Systems Biology in Engineering Conference (FOSBE), an international conference, being held in Chicago, Illinois, August 5-8, 2018. The funds provided by NSF are used to subsidize the cost of undergraduate and graduate student registration. The field of systems biology involves the holistic study of complex biological interactions in an effort to understand an organism's function. It has emerged as the bridge between the reductionist approaches of molecular and cellular biology and the more global understanding of an organism's function that is required in order to produce useful knowledge. Such knowledge would be applied to agriculture and medicine for example. The FOSBE conference convenes an international group of scientists that provides an in-depth review and critical assessment of the current state-of-the-art in systems biology and discusses the current and future needs of research, education and training for the scientific area. The conference also discusses the translation of scientific knowledge into practical applications for the benefit of society and identify new directions, opportunities and challenges in the area of systems biology. The program for this conference includes, platform presentations, as well as extended poster sessions and brainstorming sessions that allow attendees to spontaneously interact with each other. Attending undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral research associated have opportunities to give presentations and enhance their training in the area of systems. The conference proceedings and results will be published in an appropriate scientific journal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field of systems biology, and its translational science counterpart systems medicine, has emerged as the bridge between reductionist molecular and cellular biology approaches and the systems-level understanding required to use this knowledge. Drawing upon the revolutionary advances from reductionist approaches in molecular and cellular biology, systems approaches focus on the relationships between the gene, protein, and metabolite responses that compose the individual and population responses at the whole organism level. The 7th Foundations of Systems Biology in Engineering Conference provides an in-depth review and critical assessment of the current state-of-the-art and discusses current and future needs of research, education, training and translation to practice. In addition, new directions, opportunities and challenges in systems biology are identified. The activities include poster sessions, a conference proceeding and brainstorming sessions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference is co-funded by the Systems and Synthetic Biology cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Bioscience and the Engineering Biology and Health Cluster in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

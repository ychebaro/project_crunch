<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for US participation in the conference "Random Physical Systems" held in Puerto Natales, Chile, on December 11-15, 2018.  The meeting, part of the 2018 Mathematical Physics Month in Chile, is organized under the auspices of the Pontificia Universidad Catolica (PUC) de Chile and the Universidad de Magallanes.  The conference focuses on recent developments in analysis, especially in the fields of mathematical physics and probability.  This award gives US-based students, early-career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, and researchers without other sources of support an opportunity to attend and participate in the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The international conference "Random Physical Systems" will gather researchers in probability and mathematical physics to discuss topics of current research regarding random physical systems. The topics covered include random disordered systems, universality, the multi/many-particle Anderson model, random processes, statistical mechanics, and interacting particle systems.  A main goal of the conference is to expose graduate students and postdoctoral associates to the latest research on random physical systems.  The meeting will include four mini-courses in addition to research talks on a broad range of topics, allowing young researchers to learn about current activity and to meet other mathematicians working in random physical systems.  More information is available at the conference webpage: http://eventos.cmm.uchile.cl/rps-patagonia2018/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

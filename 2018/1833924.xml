<AbstractNarration>The NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) program will support the retention and graduation of high-achieving, low-income students with demonstrated financial need at Oakton Community College in Illinois. This project aims to award a total of 127 yearly scholarships to at least 47 academically talented, financially needy students pursuing degrees in mathematics, physical sciences, biological sciences, engineering or related technologies, or computer science and technology. The project will provide cohort learning experiences, a STEM/English learning community and STEM philosophy course, proactive advising, and faculty mentoring. Scholars will also have opportunities to participate in undergraduate research projects and paid internships.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The program is designed to remove some of the barriers that students encounter while enrolled in challenging STEM coursework through a holistic program of supportive services and STEM engagement. It will use the latest best practices for STEM student engagement and retention to develop novel programming focused on supporting low income students in STEM fields, as well as unifying existing support services and activities. Further, by using more intentional recruitment strategies this program also seeks to broaden the pool of STEM Scholars. Understanding the impact of this comprehensive approach at the community college level will contribute to the current knowledge base about effective practices in STEM student success. The knowledge generated by this project may be applicable to other community colleges as they develop strategies to recruit, engage, retain, and graduate and/or transfer STEM students. Collaboration with district high schools through the project?s Advisory Committee will promote shared best practices throughout the district. The STEM Scholars program has the potential to serve as a model that could be implemented by other colleges to improve STEM engagement and retention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

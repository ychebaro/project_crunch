<AbstractNarration>The conference on Witt Vectors, Deformations, and Absolute Geometry will be held at the University of Vermont, 16 July 2018-21 July 2018. This workshop will foster research interactions and will provide a setting for graduate students, as well as younger and more established mathematicians, to learn of the newest trends and interact with some of the most prominent researchers around the world. The organizers will focus financial support on graduate students and early career researchers to facilitate their participation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scientific purpose of this conference is to bring together researchers in several, disparate fields whose work is connected to Witt vectors and their related constructions. These techniques are important for extending deformation theoretic techniques to new settings and promotes research activities at the interface of algebraic geometry, algebraic topology, number theory, and applied model theory. A website for this meeting is maintained at http://www.uvm.edu/~tdupuy/witt2018.html. The slides from the conference will be posted there and left publicly available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

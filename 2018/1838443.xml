<AbstractNarration>Non-technical abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) crystals are a new class of materials that measure only a few nanometers in thickness. Recent studies have shown that these materials offer unique advantages over other known materials, and that they hold the potential to make a large impact in new-generation electronics, energy conversion, and storage applications. When these 2D crystals are stacked onto each other they form a material known as a 2D Moire superlattice, which possesses an unusual physical properties that may enable quantum computation. Such materials could revolutionize current information technologies. This research aims to reach a fundamental understanding of the optical behavior of 2D Moire superlattices using advanced optical measurement techniques, as well as develop state-of-the-art fabrication techniques to create nanoscale devices for manipulation of quantum information. The research activities have significant impact on training of next-generation researchers. Doctoral and master students, as well as undergraduates conduct all the necessary experiments, participating in hands-on research activities. The research team is preparing YouTube videos: 'Moire patterns in the nature, science, and engineering' and '2D Moire superlattices and 2D crystals', to reach out to the general public and science/technology enthusiasts. Exciting results are also shared through conference presentations, journal publications, and scientific review articles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical abstract: A quantum emitter strongly coupled to a cavity that operates down to the single-photon level is essential for quantum logic. Yet, there have been big challenges to achieve this at room temperature due to the limited coupling strength between conventional quantum emitters and optical cavities . This research explores the quantum optics of Moire quantum emitters (Moire-QEs) as single-photon emitters and their integration with Fano-dielectric metacavities, allowing manipulation of coherent states in quantum logic operations. The research projects include; i) the synthesis of optical grade, highly crystalline, and atomically clean Moire superlattices sustaining long-lived Moire-QEs through CVD and MBE methods, ii) investigation of quantum optics of Moire-QEs to identify their potential in quantum logic operation; iii) designing low-loss, high-Q, and large Rabi energy splitting metacavities, fabricating them, and integrating them with Moire-QEs to enable quantum logic operation, and lastly iv) investigation of nonlinear effects and demonstration of cross-phase modulation. The research is anticipated to lay a solid foundation towards creating large periodicity Moire-QEs and to understand their behavior related to single photon nonlinearities. In addition, the project aims to identify clear pathways towards potentially scalable quantum system design, to study room temperature quantum optical nonlinear effects, and quantum state manipulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

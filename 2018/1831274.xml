<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project can lead to a revolution in 3D microgeometry and reflectance properties measurement of object surfaces at the micron-scale range. The proposed technology will significantly improve photorealistic rendering in digital prototyping, and therefore reduce the waste from using physical material samples during design, engineering, and manufacturing. This technology will help reduce product development time and cost, and lead to a greater sustainability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will develop a computational imaging system that allows for high-resolution 3D microgeometry and reflectance properties measurement of object surfaces. The current approaches for 3D surface measurement at the micron scale are based on sophisticated optical and mechanical components that are expensive and can be difficult to use, and most of these approaches cannot capture the full appearance of a surface, such as diffuse reflection, specular reflection, and surface roughness. The goal of this research program is to develop a combination of hardware and software that can measure 3D surface microgeometry and reflectance properties with micron-scale accuracy. The proposed technology is expected to achieve superior performance at greatly reduced cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

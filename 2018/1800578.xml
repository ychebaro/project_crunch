<AbstractNarration>With funding from the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Division of Chemistry , Dr. Stephen M. Holmes of the University of Missouri-St. Louis is developing magnetic molecules to gain a better understanding of how to control magnetism within small particles. Magnetic materials find widespread use in technologically-important devices such as speakers, electrical motors, noise filters, transformers, and information storage media such as magnetic hard drives. In the case of information storage, there is an increasing emphasis on creating smaller magnetic particles to increase data storage density. Unfortunately, smaller magnetic particles often give faster data loss, limiting the usefulness of traditional hard drives. Dr. Holmes is making magnetic molecules to understand how small magnets behave under various conditions. By studying molecular models, he is establishing relationships between temperature, energy changes in the molecule, and motions, with a goal of relating these to their magnetic properties. Dr. Holmes is also actively engaged in outreach activities that encourage elementary, high school, and undergraduate students to be active participants in research and teaching. Dr. Holmes also promotes STEM outreach involving minority, female, and financially disadvantaged students. He currently supports female and minority high school and undergraduate interns and is developing laboratory experiments and STEM activities for the undergraduate laboratories at his university.  These research and training activities advance national competitiveness in high tech sectors such as computing and electronics development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Holmes is developing a better understanding of how small molecules can behave as magnets (single-molecule magnets). He is working to design late transition metal single-molecule magnetic complexes whose vibrational and electronic properties may be systematically tuned. He is working towards establishing relationships between chemical bonding, intermolecular contacts, and molecular and electronic structures. These changes are being probed using various spectroscopic and magnetic measurement techniques to deduce which structural and electronic features are most important in magnetic relaxation. He is devising synthetic approaches for slowing magnetic relaxation, leading to the preparation of materials that perform better at higher temperatures. Dr. Holmes is also developing high school and undergraduate laboratory experiments that are aimed at improving the education. He is partnering with local and national educational outreach programs to engage students from financially disadvantaged, minority-serving, and underperforming school districts in research activities, fostering their continuing interest in STEM-related fields of study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

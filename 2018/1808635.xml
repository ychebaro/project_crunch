<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical abstract:&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to understand a new state of electrons known as a Luttinger Liquid where electrons can behave like a liquid, in one-dimensional carbon nanotubes. This research will not only answer basic questions on the nature of unique electron states, but also be of great technological importance. For example, the unique properties of a Luttinger Liquid of electrons in carbon nanotubes can lead to new and robust sub-wavelength circuits and single-directional propagation of signals that are tunable with a simple electric field that cannot be achieved with current technology. In addition, the project offers an excellent opportunity to expose graduate and undergraduate students to a variety of advanced experimental skills and interdisciplinary research. The principle investigator will also reach out to a broader outside community on K-12 education through established collaboration with Cal-Teach program at Berkeley. The project will also broaden participation of underrepresented researchers by engaging female graduate students and underrepresented undergraduate in the research activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;One-dimensional Luttinger liquid establishes a new paradigm of strongly correlated electron system qualitatively different from Fermi liquid. The principle investigator will study novel Luttinger liquid phenomena in carbon nanotubes building upon his pioneering work on single-tube spectroscopy and near-field infrared nanoscopy of carbon nanotubes. Specifically, the principle investigator will explore three exciting directions: (1) Parameter-free test of Luttinger liquid phenomena in metallic carbon nanotubes, where combined electrical tunneling and optical nanoscopy allows for independent determination of electron correlation power law index and Luttinger liquid interaction parameter.  (2) Exploration of excited state dynamics of tunable nonlinear Luttinger liquid in semiconducting nanotubes. It can unravel unusual plasmon dissipation beyond the Landau damping mechanism in strongly correlated one dimensional electrons.  (3) Non-equilibrium Luttinger liquid phenomena in strongly biased metallic and semiconducting nanotubes. It will enable the observation of novel Luttinger liquid behavior far from equilibrium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

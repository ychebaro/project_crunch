<AbstractNarration>This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. Professor Bradley Kraft from St. John Fisher College and colleagues Renuka Manchanayakage and Anand Sridhar have acquired a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. This spectrometer allows research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as allow study of biologically relevant species. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The instrument positively impacts student researchers who coauthor papers and present their results at local and national conferences. The spectrometer promotes its enhanced research opportunities in its outreach, and empowers future generations in science and engineering. Secondary school students who attend Science Exploration Days participate on hands-on workshops that introduce them to NMR spectroscopy. The team of researchers also have industrial collaborations that benefit the region.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It is especially helpful in analyzing the structure, bonding, dynamics, and reactivity of Group 14 metal complexes and for characterizing, and evaluating applications of synthesized ionic liquids. The spectrometer aids investigators in designing and synthesizing inhibitors of the enzyme 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) synthase. It is also used in investigations of the phytochemical constituents of tropical, succulent flowering plants native of tropical Africa from the Kalanchoe species which may have potential antiviral properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

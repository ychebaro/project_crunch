<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2018, Broadening Participation of Groups Under-represented in Biology. The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. The research plan focuses on the evolution of animal weapons (e.g., antlers, horns), which are among the most extreme traits in the animal world. These weapons are often massive in size and grow drastically out of proportion with the body. It is therefore unsurprising that they have captured the attention of biologists for centuries, since understanding more about extreme weapons sheds light on many peculiar biological activities. Yet, despite such intense interest, surprisingly little is known about how these traits evolve. In particular, 3 questions need to be addressed: How do weapons evolve to such extreme sizes? What are the scenarios that favor weapon evolution? And what genes underlie the evolution of these traits? The research plan directly addresses these questions by exploring the evolution, ecology, and genetics of extreme animal weapons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the research plan takes an integrative approach to elucidate the evolution, ecology, and genetic regulation of extreme morphology through the study of animal weapons. The program is centered around the model weapon system Gnatocerus cornutus (broad horned flour beetles) and contains 3 research objectives: (1) determine the evolvability of extreme morphology by using artificial selection to develop lineages with divergent weapon phenotypes, (2) measure the fitness consequences of variation in weapon size by exposing these experimental lineages to ecological and social condition hypothesized to influence the evolution of selected morphology and (3) identify the genetic basis of weapon growth through QTL (quantitative trait locus) mapping of derived lineages produced via artificial selection. The fellowship also supports an associated outreach plan specifically aimed at boarding participation of underrepresented groups in biology. The outreach plan contains two objectives: (1) recruit undergraduate students from underrepresented groups and train them in all aspects of the cross-disciplinary research plan and (2) develop workshops to train and equip secondary school teachers to conduct artificial selection experiments on weapons in the classroom. Together, the research and outreach objectives provide the Fellow with extensive training in multivariate selection experiments, and the association mapping of complex traits. In addition, the Fellow also receives training in how to effectively mentor undergraduates from diverse populations and how to develop and execute productive outreach programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

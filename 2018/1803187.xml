<AbstractNarration>This National Science Foundation award enables the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) to administer a travel grant program for approximately one hundred U.S. based mathematical and computational scientists, early career faculty, and graduate students to attend the International Congress on Industrial and Applied Mathematics (ICIAM 2019), to be held July 15-19, 2019 at the Universidad Valencia, Valencia, Spain. The ICIAM is the premier international conference for applied mathematics, with approximately 500-750 U.S. participants anticipated. Travel grants to applicants will be awarded on a competitive basis. Applications will be evaluated by a panel of professional mathematical and computational scientists to select a diverse group of well-qualified researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Applied and computational mathematics are global enterprises with significant impact on technology and economic development. ICIAM is an effective way to foster the interaction of U.S. mathematical and computational scientists with the international community of researchers and practitioners from academia, government and industry. The program for ICIAM 2019 will be distinguished by its focus and its outstanding speakers selected by the scientific program committee.  Focus areas in applied, industrial and computational mathematics will be chosen based on their current and future importance. More information about the conference is available at http://iciam2019.org/.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

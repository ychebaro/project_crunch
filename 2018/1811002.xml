<AbstractNarration>This National Science Foundation award supports the fourth and fifth in the previously funded, successful series of Central States Mathematics Undergraduate Research (CeSMUR) conferences that will take place on April 20-21, 2018 in Lincoln, Nebraska, and in spring 2019 in Manhattan, Kansas, respectively. Research experience is very helpful in both the graduate application process, and in placement in technically demanding jobs. The scientific activities and mentoring interactions at CeSMUR are designed to encourage undergraduate students who are already engaged in research, and to inspire others to begin.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The conference is comprised of one and a half days. The format follows the one successfully tested in previous editions. Two main speakers each give a one-hour lecture, and there is ample time for undergraduate student speakers to present their research. During the evening and lunch meetings students interact with the featured speakers and guest graduate students in attendance, and get advice on the next steps in their career. In addition to a commitment to increasing the number of highly trained STEM professionals, the conferences focus on increasing diversity in the mathematical workforce, via participation of first generation college students, females, and underrepresented minority groups.  Further details regarding the 2018 CeSMUR conference can be found on the conference website: https://www.math.unl.edu/events/cesmur.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>The research supported by this award looks at how national, state, and local policies, discourses, and people interact to produce a local service choice environment.  Policy development may assume a direct translation from the objectives developed at federal and state levels to implementation and response at the community level.  But the United States comprises a great diversity of local contexts. This research addresses the important question of how that diversity affects policy implementation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be conducted by anthropologists Sarah B. Horton (University of Colorado at Denver) and Whitney L. Duncan (University of Northern Colorado). The researchers have chosen to focus on local perceptions of health care service availability as a case study of policy devolution. They will undertake a comparative, longitudinal investigation of how specific residents in two different sites in Colorado, one urban and one rural, connect with and understand the availability of health care services for chronic diseases. Policies are standard across the state but are mediated by different local institutional, historical, and sociocultural contexts. The goal is to see what difference those contexts make. Working cooperatively with local clinics, they will collect data through interviews and participant observation with local stakeholders, patients, and health care staff. They will also analyze local media accounts and relevant documents. Findings from this research will be valuable for policy makers, service providers, and service users. The research will also enrich social scientific understanding of the complex functioning of the contemporary state and the different ways in which citizenship is made concrete at the local level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

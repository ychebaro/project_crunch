<AbstractNarration>The ability to pattern designed nanoscale structures precisely is critical for research in nanoscience. Electron Beam Lithography, which uses a scanning electron beam, is one of the most reliable and powerful methods to create patterns with sub-10 nm resolution in a relatively large surface area. This project enables Baylor University to acquire an Ultrahigh Resolution Electron Beam Lithography System for the development of a high-impact, multidisciplinary program of nanoscience research and education at Baylor University. Instrument users will include faculty and students from Baylor University's Physics, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Chemistry and Biochemistry, and Environmental Science departments. The instrument will expand nanofabrication capabilities at Baylor University for studying physics, optics, chemistry, biology sensing, and optical device applications on the nanometer scale. The instrument's capabilities will open the path for researchers to explore promising nanoscale sciences and applications. The electron beam lithography system will also be incorporated into education and outreach activities, including the Baylor Mayborn Museum events, online outreach activities, Baylor Summer Science Research Program, Advanced Instrumentation Workshop, and Optical Society of America events and workshops. The research and training opportunities provided by this nanofabrication instrument will align with Baylor University's strategic plan to advance research and education and strengthen the engagement with the community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will acquire an Ultrahigh Resolution Electron Beam Lithography System to support nanoscience and nanotechnology research and education. The tool provides ultrahigh resolution patterning (&lt;8 nm) in combination with the highest level of automation for complex applications. The thermal field emission filament technology, cross-over-free beam path, and column technology produce an extremely high beam current density, extremely low aberrations, fast writing speed, large field sizes, and millimeter-long periodic patterns with zero stitching errors. No other laboratory in the Central Texas region has this type of instrument critical to state-of-the-art nanoscience research. The instrument is ideally suited for research in nano-optics/photonics, nano-biophysics, nano-chemistry, and large-area nanoscale electronic and photonic devices. Examples of the nanoscale applications that can be fabricated include tunable ultrathin optical metasurface components, nanoscale and portable surface-enhanced coherent Raman sensors, point-of-care on-chip optical biosensors, plasmon-assisted photocatalytic reactors, efficient nanoscale bio-medical applications, and next-generation nano-electronic/photonic devices. The acquisition of this electron beam lithography system will not only enable innovative system-oriented nanoscience and nanodevice research activities at Baylor University and nearby colleges, but also facilitate the training of a new generation of students and postdoctoral researchers on nanoscience and nanoengineering at Baylor University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

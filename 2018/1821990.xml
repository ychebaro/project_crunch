<AbstractNarration>This award provides travel support for students to attend and present their work at the IEEE International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics, 2018 (BHI18). BHI18 is the premier flagship conference sponsored by IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS) in the area of mHealth and health analytics. BHI18 will be held from March. 4-8, 2018 in Las Vegas and jointly organized with IEEE conference on Body Sensor Networks. The goal of the conference is to provide a unique platform to showcase novel sensors, systems, signal processing, analytics and data management services. BHI18 will offer the latest findings of researchers on efficient and innovative signal acquisition, transmission, processing, monitoring, storage, retrieval, analysis, visualization and interpretation of multi-modal signals including physiological, biomedical, biological, social, behavioral, environmental, and geographical data. It will also provide a forum for bioinformatics and computational biology researchers in especially EMBS and IEEE Signal Processing Society to interact and exchange research ideas among them and others in Biomedical and Health Informatics community and discuss future challenges in cutting edge areas including Precision Medicine. As integrated bioinformatics and medical informatics approaches become one of the focus areas in Precision Medicine, BHI18 is uniquely positioned to spark novel ideas and promote new collaborations between researchers in these communities.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An important mission of the Workshop is to promote participation of graduate students, especial woman and minority students, and foster student education on computational biology for precision medicine. This award will be used to provide travel grants to qualified graduate students, whose papers are deemed of high quality, to support their participation in the conference. The Workshop organization includes the student award committee, which will be responsible for evaluation and selection of student awardees. Particularly, 20-30% of the awards are allocated to women and minority students to participate and submit papers to the Workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>Separation and purification processes are essential to production of biochemicals, biopharmaceuticals, chemicals, drugs, food products, gaseous/liquid fuels, healthcare products, metals, potable water, semi-conductor chips among others. Membrane-based separation/purification processes are becoming increasingly important in manufacturing such products. A membrane allows selective transport of one species from one phase on one side of the membrane to another phase on the other side of the membrane; often a membrane acting as a barrier selectively blocks one or more species from going through (e.g., membrane-based protective clothing against toxic gases). The species may be molecules in gaseous/liquid phase, ions in solution, macromolecules, nanoparticles, micron-size particles. Membrane devices and processes are favored due to lower energy consumption (e.g., desalination), easy scale-up (e.g., natural gas purification), smaller footprint (e.g., membrane contactors) and are the only viable option in kidney dialysis. The New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) site of the Membrane Science, Engineering and Technology Center (MAST Center) is focused on solving specific separation problems by developing advanced membranes and characterizing such membranes and processes. NJIT site provides advanced education, training and research opportunities to students and young researchers on research topics specified by MAST Sponsors: industrial corporations, national laboratories and federal agencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MAST Center is a multi-university-based industry-university cooperative research center with three university sites. Guided by members of the industrial advisory board (IAB), MAST Center 1) conducts fundamental research in membranes via innovative materials and processes facilitating the use of membrane technology for current/emerging industrial applications; (2) sustains technological leadership in membrane materials and membrane-based separation processes and facilitates commercialization of innovative technologies; and (3) provides undergraduate and graduate students, and post-doctoral fellows with a relevant educational and research experience. The Center-spanning research themes aligned with IAB interests are: water treatment, bioseparations, membrane fabrication and characterization, organic solvent processing, gas separations, barrier membranes. NJIT's MAST Center faculty from four academic departments have their research focus on water treatment, barrier membranes, organic solvent-based system processing and membrane characterization. Research thrust areas of special interest to NJIT MAST faculty are: water treatment membranes for desalination, industrial effluent treatment and recovery of chemicals and metals by novel membranes, organic solvent-based system processing with solvent-resistant membranes, barrier membranes for chemical and biological protection. Research on advanced membrane materials and structures and their incorporation in novel separation devices/schemes are expected to respond to challenging separation and purification needs encountered by current and potential membrane users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>This award to the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory will support a workshop for directors operating Research Experiences for Undergraduate (EU) sites.  Site directors will share best practices in implementing undergraduate research programs and discuss issues faced by program directors of REU Site programs.  The primary focus of the workshop is student assessment of the research experience and long-term tracking of participants. BIO-funded REU program directors will be invited to the 3-day workshop, that starts on April 4th, 2019. It is expected that 140-150 participants will attend the workshop, which will occur at the Holiday Inn Rosslyn in Arlington, VA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, the grant will implement updates to the existing BIO REU website (bioreu.org), migrating the website to a new content management system that allows for increased capacity to manage content. The website is a primary means for REU students and PIs to share resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The REU program is one of the primary mechanisms NSF has to support broader participation in the sciences.  The workshop will make REU programs more effective through sharing of best practices.  Additionally, the US Congress has mandated longitudinal tracking of student participants.  This workshop will discuss ways so that the intent by Congress is appropriately met.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The REU program helps support the research activities of 1,000+ scientists, generating hundreds of scientific publications.  Under the supervision of a scientist, undergraduates perform their own research projects.  This complements the work of their mentors, and advances our fundamental understanding of biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

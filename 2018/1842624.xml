<AbstractNarration>This project proposes funding for SmartCloud 2017 (The 2nd IEEE International Conference on SmartCloud 2017, http://smartcloud2017.smart-com.org) to support undergraduate/graduate students, especially under-represented students, who are interested in cloud computing research and pursuing cloud-related research work.  Student presenters/attendees learn a great deal by participating in this type of academic event. SmartCoud 2017 has multiple parallel sessions with different foci where professional presentations on recent research will be presented by senior researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a serious plan to recruit minority students and underrepresented groups, engage them in the activities provided by the conference, such as panels and workshops, and give them priority to participate when opportunities are limited.  The conference provides a valuable forum for introducing new techniques, sharing new tools, and reviewing upcoming publications to future potential researchers, allowing for opportunities to advance their education and explore career development by building professional and academic social networks.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>As a satellite activity to the 2018 International Congress of Mathematicians in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), August 1-9, there will be a K-theory conference in Argentina, consisting of two parts: a School at the University Nacional de La Plata (in La Plata, Argentina) during July 16-20, followed by an international Workshop on K-theory at the University of Buenos Aires (Argentina) during July 23-27, 2018. This award supports US-based graduate students and young researchers to participate in the School and the Workshop. The meetings aim to catalyze research and disseminate new techniques that will allow researchers to better understand how mathematics fits together. The results will be published, both in on-line archiving sites and in published form in scientific journals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The School will consist of 6 mini-courses, covering combinatorial aspects, relation to conjectures in algebraic topology, homotopy invariance, applications to physics, and classification of approximately finite-dimensional algebras.  The Workshop will allow researchers to share their recent discoveries about how K-theory helps us understand a wide-ranging family of mathematical structures and their invariants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The web page for this conference is&lt;br/&gt;www.mate.unlp.edu.ar/~gtartaglia/ktheoryconference.html&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

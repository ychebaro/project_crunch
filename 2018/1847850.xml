<AbstractNarration>This doctoral dissertation project will investigate the relationship between physiology and behavior when humans are exposed to novel, challenging environments. The project will draw upon core bodies of research on biological plasticity and adaptation, energy allocation and expenditure, and social cooperation. This research will facilitate new insights on how humans acclimate to extreme cold and high altitude demands, which will broadly inform research on human capacities to respond to the diverse range of ecological stressors found throughout the world. This study will help train a woman of color at the University of Notre Dame for her PhD and will also help in the training of undergraduate and junior graduate students in the Hormones, Health, &amp; Human Behavior Lab, of which ~80% of lab members are women and underrepresented minority students. In conjunction with the National Outdoor Leadership School, the investigator has created a project website that both students and the public can easily access for preliminary findings and updates on the study. The research team has also heavily engaged in public outreach, including presentations for elementary and middle school classes, public lectures to local communities, and promoting scientific inquiry and sharing research through popular science articles, podcasts, and social media venues like Twitter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to help understand how humans biologically and behaviorally acclimate to novel and challenging ecologies, specifically via the relationships between energetic/metabolic physiology, neuroendocrine systems, and social dynamics. The investigator will study individuals participating in ~90 day expeditions through the American Rockies as a part of the National Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS). In such environments (e.g. high altitude or cold), ecological and psychological stressors impose intensive demands on human physiology, including metabolic and psychobiological functioning. The research will address larger discussions about (i) biological variation, plasticity, and adaptation in challenging ecologies, (ii) life history- and ecological-based perspectives on energetic allocation and expenditure, and (iii) the evolution and function of prosociality, cooperation, and collective action. Recognizing the relationship and nuances between physiology and behavior may give critical insight into the success of human global expansion and settlement, with implications for human health and well-being as well as future exploration, and habitation of increasingly changing and unique ecologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

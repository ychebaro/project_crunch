<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Alabama A&amp;M University seeks to improve undergraduate students' preparation and success towards a career in nuclear engineering or an advanced degree by focusing on active learning strategies. Undergraduate students are involved in the project as researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has the objectives to: enhance student learning and technical skills by integrating active learning units into nuclear engineering courses; study the efficacy of the active learning model and units on nuclear engineering skill-set development; and improve retention and graduation rates in nuclear engineering programs, thus increasing the participation of women and underrepresented minorities in the nuclear engineering workforce. This project is guided by formative and summative evaluation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

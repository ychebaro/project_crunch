<AbstractNarration>Midwest Women in Mathematics Symposium (WIMS) has been an annual event since 2013, hosted by different universities in the Midwest region each year. The host of 2019 symposium is the University of Iowa. It is the first time that the meeting is taking place in the West of the Mississippi River. The meeting brings female graduate students and professional mathematicians of all ranks from postdoctoral researchers to professors together to discuss current mathematical research problems and learn how to search for academic and STEM-related jobs. (The symposium is open to everyone regardless of gender.) In this modern age, the development of mathematics is significantly fast and areas of research are widely spread. Reality is that people in different fields hardly communicate and collaborate. The Symposium is essential in bridging these gaps by building a sense of community among women in mathematics starting with the Midwest and promoting new research collaborations and mentoring relations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this symposium, presenters and speakers are chosen from four mathematical fields; (i) Algebra, (ii) Analysis and Partial Differential Equations, (iii) Mathematical Biology, and (iv) Geometry and Topology, that vary from pure math to applied math. One of the goals of the Symposium is to encounter current hot subjects in these and related fields. The Symposium features two one-hour plenary talks, twelve thirty-minute invited lectures and eight graduate student presentations in four parallel sessions and also a discussion on career issues. Especially the plenary talks are delivered in colloquium style to make the information more accessible to general audiences. In the parallel sessions, more detailed presentations of research will be given. Presentations by graduate students (which is a new feature of 2019 symposium, replacing presenting posters only in previous meetings) is expected to help them better in finding future collaborators and academic/non-academic positions.  More information about the Symposium including the list of speakers and abstracts will be available at the symposium web page: https://math.uiowa.edu/news-events/7th-midwest-women-mathematics-symposium&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

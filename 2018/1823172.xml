<AbstractNarration>A core tenet of the scientific method is reproducibility of experiments. To reproduce an empirical study in software engineering research, it is necessary to use the same experimental subjects and equivalent experimental infrastructure. Reproducibility in software engineering research is an important topic, as is evident from the recent establishment of artifact evaluation committees and from publication of papers with conflicting results. Prior efforts to establish reusable artifacts for specific software engineering domains are based on artificial data, are too small, are not uniformly organized, and/or lack extensible infrastructure. This holds the software engineering research community back, hampers reproducibility and comparability, and reduces confidence in empirical results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project promotes reproducibility and comparability in software engineering research, through a large-scale database of real software defects and a standardized infrastructure that enables controlled experiments. It enhances an existing prototype (Defects4J) by adding new artifacts, adding infrastructure for labeling and experimenting with the artifacts, and improving usability. Specifically, this project provides (1) the world's largest database of isolated and annotated real software defects, (2) an extensible mining infrastructure that supports automated defect mining and isolation, (3) an extensible experimental infrastructure that also includes a statistics and replication package component, and (4) tutorials and training materials for researchers and educators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project advances software engineering research in three ways. (1) It enables researchers to perform more realistic experiments, using real instead of artificial defects. (2) It frees researchers from the burden of (re-)developing an experimental infrastructure, allowing them to focus on research ideas. (3) It fosters reproducibility and comparability by providing reusable artifacts and data sets.  Furthermore, this project advances software engineering education at the undergraduate and graduate level: students can experiment with existing techniques, reproduce published results, or quickly evaluate new ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>In the past two decades, implicit solvent models are of tremendous importance to the biomolecular&lt;br/&gt;modeling community with thousands of exemplary applications in the literature due to their low&lt;br/&gt;computational cost and relatively high accuracy. The accuracy of implicit solvent models depends&lt;br/&gt;on the geometric description of the solute-solvent interface and the solvent dielectric profile that&lt;br/&gt;is defined near the molecules. Successful implementations of the proposed model in this project with&lt;br/&gt;realistically generated solute-solvent smooth boundaries will greatly improve the accuracy and&lt;br/&gt;efficiency of these implicit solvent models. This investigation will be directly integrated into existing&lt;br/&gt;implicit solvent software and visualization packages to ensure extensive usages by an established&lt;br/&gt;user community of researchers in chemistry, physics, and biology. Moreover, the proposed work will  present &lt;br/&gt;an unconventional computational method for diffuse interface models applied to spatial multiscale modeling &lt;br/&gt;in mathematical biology. Successful development of the proposed work will become a valuable computational&lt;br/&gt;tool for studying the transition between regions described by discrete and continuum models. &lt;br/&gt;The outcome will have potential impacts across a wide range of scientific fields such as multiscale&lt;br/&gt;modeling in cancer research and drug design. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop a novel computational method for diffuse interface models of&lt;br/&gt;implicit solvation of biomolecules. The computational approach will be mathematically rigorous and&lt;br/&gt;computationally efficient to generate physically realistic solute-solvent smooth boundaries by free&lt;br/&gt;energy minimization. To this end, an innovative construction is proposed to transform a variational&lt;br/&gt;problem subject to bounded admissible functions into an equivalent unconstrained problem so&lt;br/&gt;that the traditional Euler-Lagrange Equation can be applied directly. This new computational&lt;br/&gt;formulation will be implemented with advanced computational algorithms to ensure their accuracy,&lt;br/&gt;stability, and efficiency, and it will be validated by several common biomolecular modeling tasks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

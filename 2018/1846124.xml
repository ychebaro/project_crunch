<AbstractNarration>Major new scientific instruments now planned for forefront research in physics and astronomy will require very large ultrahigh-vacuum facilities. In some areas, such as the next generation of laser interferometer gravitational wave observatories, the vacuum system is expected to form the dominant construction cost. Vacuum systems are also expected to be major cost drivers for advanced plasma fusion and particle accelerator concepts now under development. This workshop aims to compare vacuum needs of these future research facilities and to explore recent advances, new insights, and novel concepts that could render major cost savings in their realization. Doing so will help assure continued leadership in exploring our physical universe and in educating, enlightening and informing the public, with minimal future burden on public funds.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LIGO Laboratory will host the workshop at the LIGO Livingston or LIGO Hanford observatory site in calendar 2019. Approximately 21 recognized vacuum experts will be invited to represent leading US and international research facilities and key supporting industries involved in applying large-scale vacuum system technology to fundamental research. They will join LIGO Laboratory faculty and staff for 3 working days with a mixture of presentations and panel-mediated discussions. Expected outcomes include the cross-pollination of technology paradigms between disparate fields and projects, and possible synthesis of entirely novel construction and fabrication concepts for future development.  Upon conclusion of the Workshop, the Organizing Committee will publish a publicly accessible  synopsis highlighting these findings and recommending directions for future pursuit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the STEM workforce through the development of highly competitive students from groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines: African-Americans, Alaska Natives, American Indians, Hispanic Americans,Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders. The goal of the LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Activity is to increase the quantity and competitiveness of STEM graduate students from historically underrepresented minority populations, with emphasis on STEM doctoral matriculation and completion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2018-2020 Western Alliance to Expand Student Opportunities (WAESO) LSAMP BD program will recruit twelve (12) alumni from LSAMP institutions nationwide for STEM postbaccalaureate studies at the University of Arizona (UA).   Student support in the form of stipends and cost of education are provided for two years for each student. The institution commits to assisting the students financially through research and teaching assistantships as well as through competitive institutional fellowship opportunities to complete the STEM doctoral degree program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The evaluation consists of formative and summative approaches and incorporates the graduate education self-efficacy scale (GESES) instrument which quantifies self-efficacy for academic, research and social skills.  Outcomes will be disseminated broadly through the institution's website, scholarly journals, and presentations at STEM professional conferences. The project findings from the research and evaluative activities increases scholarly knowledge on broadening participation in STEM disciplines at the graduate and post-graduate level while contributing to the diversity of the nation's STEM workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

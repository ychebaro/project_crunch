<AbstractNarration>International research collaborations are supported using a variety of partnership models. However, what works under what circumstances and why is poorly documented.  This workshop will engage key thought leaders from across the globe in a dynamic discussion of the critical issues related to international partnerships and collaborations to leverage resources, maximize synergies, and accelerate research.  Workshop participants will examine existing models of international funding partnerships and contribute to an action plan.  The workshop activities will promote partnerships, establish shared learning, and strengthen connections to support the implementation of international network-to-network collaborations responsive to global research to benefit society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this workshop is to identify the overarching issues related to international network-to-network partnerships, categorize and prioritize these issues, and develop potential solutions to tackle these challenges.  Representatives from stakeholders in international research networks who are knowledgeable about or have an interest in building network-to-network partnerships will come together in a facilitated discussion.  The workshop provides a structure that supports interaction and collaboration of key stakeholders to co-create a partnership model to support international networks of networks.  A formalized report of the workshop will (1) summarize effective partnership models, (2) capture strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats to international network-to-network collaborations, and (3) propose an action plan.  The workshop and report will increase awareness of critical issues related to strengthening international research collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

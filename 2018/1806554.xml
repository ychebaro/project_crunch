<AbstractNarration>Gamma-rays are the highest energy form of electromagnetic radiation. Observations of astrophysical gamma-rays serve as probes of physical conditions and processes in the most extreme environments throughout the Universe and can be used to test fundamental physics.  The Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS), located in southern Arizona, is a ground-based observatory designed to study high energy gamma-rays.  VERITAS has unique capabilities, providing high sensitivity pointed observations of both galactic and extragalactic sources.  This award supports scientists at Barnard College to carry out research with VERITAS.  The group will participate in both technical operations in support of the observatory and in scientific investigations with a focus on studying emission from active galaxies, pulsar wind nebulae, and unidentified gamma-ray sources.  The Barnard College group is heavily engaged in education and outreach efforts.  They involve undergraduate students in astrophysics research with an emphasis on broadening the participation of women.  They are also involved in outreach efforts to high-school students in the New York City area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;VERITAS has embarked upon a broad program of galactic and extragalactic source observations, as well as studies of signatures for new physics such as dark matter.  With this award the Barnard College group will participate in VERITAS observing campaigns and carry out scientific data analysis with a focus on the extragalactic physics of active galaxies and cosmology.  Their scientific program will also include the study of galactic sources such as pulsar wind nebulae, investigating the nature of unidentified gamma-ray sources, and using multi-messenger approaches to investigate the origin of cosmic rays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

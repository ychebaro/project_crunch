<AbstractNarration>Farley-Buneman (FB) wave instability is triggered in a partially ionized plasma when a cross-field drift of electrons relative to ions exceeds a critical threshold value. This phenomenon substantially modifies current flows, and thus affects the response of the entire Magnetosphere-Ionosphere (MI) system, primarily during storm-time. FB waves also produce strong radar echoes, and these allow monitoring of the MI system. The original theory of FB waves is based on linear, local fluid theory that does not account for many observed aspects of the waves. The results of the work would improve understanding of MI coupling not only though the modification of models of this coupling, but also through the diagnostic use of the radar echoes produced by FB waves. The project will fund a graduate student and engage Master's and undergraduate students in space research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigators (PIs) will synthesize improved theory, nonlinear numerical simulation, and numerous disparate observations, including measurements from the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) heater. The project will implement a new approach to radar imaging using "compressive sensing."  This technique has been transformative in other fields, and is seen as potentially beneficial to the Coupling, Energetics and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions (CEDAR) radio science community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

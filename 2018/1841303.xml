<AbstractNarration>The Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) workshop is an annual event with the goal of encouraging participation of junior researchers in integer programming and related areas. A primary focus of this workshop is to showcase young researchers; to increase the visibility for accomplished students at an early stage in their career; and to provide an opportunity for graduate students to network with the world's top researchers. This award will provide funds for 10 graduate students to attend the 15th MIP workshop, each of whom will be presenting his or her poster at the workshop. MIP student poster sessions provide students with an opportunity to highlight their ongoing work and network with other researchers from industry and academia. During the workshop, student posters are also judged by a workshop committee and outstanding posters are recognized.  This award provides travel support for 10 student poster presenters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2018 MIP workshop will be held from June 18th to June 21st, 2018 in Greenville, South Carolina. The solicitation for the poster presentations will be sent to a variety of mailing lists, with particular effort to broaden participation by attracting students from underrepresented groups in engineering. By providing travel funds for graduate students, NSF will help to decrease the cost of attendance to encourage participation of students and will support the engagement of STEM students in emerging research in the field of MIP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

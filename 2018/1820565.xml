<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: This project focuses on understanding how batteries work at the atomic level. There are many methods for generating energy, but ultimately the limitation is often how to store that energy. Today, society is highly dependent on batteries, including rechargeable ones. Layered materials, such as molybdenum disulphide, may provide the key to improving these batteries. Transmission electron microscopy allows researchers to observe and identify individual atoms, but the data generated in such studies can only be fully interpreted using advanced materials-modeling methods. By working with engineers and chemists at the Yardney Division of EaglePicher, undergraduate and graduate students gain a broad practical understanding of batteries, while also developing the expertise and skills necessary to improve these batteries. In doing so, students need a combined understanding of ceramics, materials science, physics, chemistry and electrochemistry. A postdoctoral associate is performing in situ experiments and is linking the computer modeling to understand how the metals and layered material react.  Graduates are then well positioned to join companies across a spectrum (from transportation to medical implants) where they are urgently needed across the U.S. The broader impact of this research is ensured by participating in several community outreach activities including the UConn Mentor Connection (for high-school students) and the Kids are Scientists Too (KAST) K-12 summer program (which targets diverse and underrepresented groups and the Northeast Alliance). These laboratories also participate in a pre-college experience program for high-school junior and senior students where students interact with professors and graduate students.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: This project focuses on the characterization and modeling intercalation at the atomic scale. This research combines in situ experimentation in the transmission electron microscope with atomic scale modeling methods to improve our understanding of how lithium and sodium move into and out from layered materials (i.e. intercalation). These layered materials are a critical component of rechargeable batteries and the intercalation process is how recharging and charging is accomplished. This research compares the intercalation process for graphite and several transition metal dichalcogenides including molybdenum disulphide. This project makes full use of the recent advances in both characterization and the computing methodologies that allow the investigation of the mechanisms at the same length scales, and also builds a strong link to industry that relies on this technology and needs safer and more reliable batteries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

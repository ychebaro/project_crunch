<AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to the University of Maine, located in Orono, ME, will support the training 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2019-2021.  The REU Site theme implements convergent thinking to solve complex, interdependent problems in human, animal and environmental health (One Health). Faculty mentors represent the Schools of Food and Agriculture, Marine Sciences, Biology and Ecology, Wildlife, Forestry, Economics and Climate Change. REU students conduct research on topics such as ecology/health of wild animals (e.g. wild turkey, moose, seals) in relationship to livestock/human health and explore relevant environmental policy. REU students also participate in workshops on mentor-mentee relationships, goal-setting, research design/ethics; data collection, analysis and interpretation; and communication and collaborative problem solving skills. Students present their results at an annual One Health symposium. The REU will strive to enroll at least 50% under-represented students in STEM (African Americans, Hispanics, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians or Other Pacific Islanders), veterans, and early-career (freshmen to juniors, community college) or first-generation college students. Students apply online and applications are immediately reviewed by the leadership team, with mentor assignment and discussion of project topic prior to program start.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program.  Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present results of their work at scientific conferences. Each student will be paired with a secondary broader impacts mentor, who will share the relevance of One Health research to ?real world? problems and foster career options in their field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A common web-based assessment tool used by all REU Site programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (DBI) will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students will be tracked after the program to determine their career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information about the program is available by visiting https://nsfa.umaine.edu/one-health/REU, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Anne Lichtenwalner at anne.lichtenwalner@maine.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Kristina Cammen at kristina.cammen@maine.edu). This award is supported by DBI in the Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) and the EPSCoR program in the Office of Integrative Activities (OIA).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

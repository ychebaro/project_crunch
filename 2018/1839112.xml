<AbstractNarration>The project supports a workshop on 'Multiscale Modeling in Biology', to be held on May 20-22, 2019 at the University of Minnesota.  Biological systems often involve complex processes that span spatial and temporal scales, ranging from the molecular and cell levels to the tissue and organism levels.  The development of multiscale mathematical models, capable of resolving the interaction between phenomena at each scale, is instrumental in understanding these processes. The conference aims to foster an exchange of ideas between researchers working in diverse biological applications using common multiscale modeling frameworks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the conference will be on mathematical models spanning the molecular, cellular and tissue scales, with an emphasis on problems that involve signal transduction, shape changes, movement, and growth. A variety of biological application areas will be represented, including tissue organization, development, and cancer. A key theme will be the interplay of mechanics and biochemistry, which is central to many of these problems. To this end, 18 confirmed speakers will present work spanning the development of new multiscale techniques and their application in reaction dynamics, signaling networks, cell motility, development and tumor dynamics. In addition, the workshop will bring together a new generation of researchers with established topical experts to cultivate new collaborations and networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

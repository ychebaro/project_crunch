<AbstractNarration>Basaltic explosive eruptions are highly dynamic, and prone to transitions in style and intensity that cannot yet be predicted. This diversity is exemplified by two island volcanoes: Kilauea in Hawaii and Stromboli in Italy. Both are very active volcanoes and both are associated with growing volcano tourism critical to island economy.  Their eruptions pose constant challenges for management agencies, exemplified by the situation at Kilauea as this award is being made, because the eruption sites are highly accessible and there is a need to balance the strong popular interest in viewing the eruptive activity against public safety. This balance requires critically on sophisticated knowledge of the volcanoes current and immediately future behavior. There is both a public desire for better knowledge of the volcano's behavior and a need for improved forecasting of the likely course and footprint of all future eruptions. The approach is expected to identify patterns and precursors indicative of changing in style, supporting management of risk at the world's most popular 'tourist volcanoes'. Observatory partners in this study have federally mandated roles to advise response agencies in Hawaii and Italy and will transfer knowledge to the bodies charged with risk management. This project will involve exchange of material and ideas between institutions in the USA, the United Kingdom, and Italy to the benefit of young researchers and students. The results will be widely disseminated via meetings and workshops, courses offered by the FEMA-funded National Disaster Preparedness Training Center at UH, the Internet and scientific publications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a rich behavioral spectrum at basaltic explosive volcanoes which spans from passive degassing through isolated, impulsive bubble bursts and powerful single explosions, to unsteady spattering of variable intensity, and to sustained but pulsatory pyroclastic fountains.  The goal of the study links these patterns and transitions of explosive basaltic eruptions to the physical processes in the vent and very shallow conduit that cause and shape them. It focuses on questions like: 1) What drives rapid changes from spaced sequences of discrete explosions to prolonged intervals of sustained fountaining? 2) What are the links between eruption style/dynamics and exsolved gas flux and chemistry?  3) How do changing vent characteristics influence style and intensity? Answers to these and other key questions will be achieved by field measurements of high temporal and spatial resolution using synchronized FTIR and gas cameras together with high-speed cameras (visual and infrared wave bands). It focuses on already tightly constrained key eruptions at these volcanoes, in particular activity at Kamoamoa in 2011 and Halema'uma'u in 2008-2018 at Kilauea and especially the newly started eruption along Kilauea's Lower East Rift Zone. These observations of dynamics of eruptive process will be paired with geophysical data to quantify and explain fine-scale temporal and spatial variations in explosive activity at basaltic volcanoes. The project addresses the second theme of the 2017 National Academy of Sciences report on the future of volcano science, namely, to collect high-resolution measurements at more volcanoes and throughout their life cycle to overcome observational bias. The study will fundamentally improve understanding of the behaviors of Hawaiian and Strombolian volcanoes and help assess hazards of future explosive events at basaltic centers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

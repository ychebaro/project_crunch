<AbstractNarration>The Dauphin Island Sea Laboratory (DISL) located on Dauphin Island, AL in the northern Gulf of Mexico, will host a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program. The program will bring eight undergraduates each summer to DISL to conduct independent research projects with the guidance of research mentors. The program will provide a strong integration of field and lab-based studies across disciplines and proximity to a range of ecosystems. In addition to independent research in marine science, students will participate in a series of seminars, field trips, and enrichment activities designed to develop the skills critical to a career in science. Students will present a final poster at a formal symposium, with the goal of contributing to a peer-reviewed paper and presenting their work at a scientific meeting following the summer internship. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theme of the DISL REU program is understanding the marine and estuarine ecosystems and living resources of the Gulf of Mexico, including research topics such as benthic ecology, fisheries and marine mammal ecology, toxicology, and biological, chemical, and physical oceanography. The program will conduct a national search for applicants and seeks to engage students who are from schools with limited research opportunities, particularly those in the Gulf Coast region. Most of the funding provided supports student stipends, housing and travel to attend the program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rutgers REU Site will provide a total of twenty-four undergraduates with internships over the three-year period. This project supports the national goals of developing the next generation of scientists and the scientific workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

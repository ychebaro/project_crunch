<AbstractNarration>This project aims to enable long-time simulations of reactive molecular systems through efficient&lt;br/&gt;and scalable techniques. Long-time reactive simulations are critical for several scientific problems&lt;br/&gt;such as catalysis, battery interfaces, biological simulations involving water, and emerging&lt;br/&gt;areas like surface oxidation and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth. However, progress on&lt;br/&gt;these fronts is limited because long-time simulations of large-scale systems are very difficult, if&lt;br/&gt;not impossible, to perform using existing methods. The Reactive Force Field (ReaxFF) method is in principle  &lt;br/&gt;ideally suited for this purpose. However, the short time steps required in current ReaxFF simulations &lt;br/&gt;and the computationally expensive force field formulation limit ReaxFF's temporal capabilities to &lt;br/&gt;narrow simulation time ranges. This project aims to overcome such limitations by creating ReaxFF2,&lt;br/&gt;which will extend time scales by one to two orders of magnitude - thus making large-scale, &lt;br/&gt;long-time RMD simulations accessible to a wide community. Codes developed will be made publicly &lt;br/&gt;available and results from this project will be highlighted on a dedicated website, and they will also be &lt;br/&gt;incorporated into workshops by the PIs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In creating ReaxFF2, the PIs will enhance the Reax force field formulation significantly, and develop &lt;br/&gt;innovative algorithms and software implementations for scalable simulations. More specifically, &lt;br/&gt;alternative ReaxFF interactions will be formulated to eliminate sharp derivatives in energy terms &lt;br/&gt;and enhance ReaxFF time step lengths by at least a factor of four. To accelerate the dynamic charge &lt;br/&gt;distribution models needed in RMD, scalable parallel preconditioning techniques for the iterative &lt;br/&gt;solvers will be developed. A task parallel approach to compute interactions, hierarchical problem &lt;br/&gt;decomposition, vectorization of the key kernels, and use of mixed precision arithmetics constitute&lt;br/&gt;the main techniques that will be utilized to fully leverage the performance capabilities of large&lt;br/&gt;computer clusters. Finally, capabilities of accelerated RMD concepts in the proposed ReaxFF2 &lt;br/&gt;formulation will be evaluated and inlined trajectory analysis tools for RMD will be developed &lt;br/&gt;to facilitate the study of long-time RMD simulations. This project will significantly enhance the PIs' &lt;br/&gt;software development, community building,  and sustenance efforts for the RMD community. Codes, &lt;br/&gt;functional forms, and parameter sets developed will be made publicly available, enabling fast and &lt;br/&gt;accurate modeling of diverse reactive systems beyond the scope of this project. For community outreach, &lt;br/&gt;results from this project will be highlighted on a dedicated website, and they will also be incorporated &lt;br/&gt;into workshops by the PIs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure is jointly supported by the Division of Materials Research &lt;br/&gt;and the Division of Chemistry within the NSF Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>Part I&lt;br/&gt;The primary Early Career Training Cruise objective will involve hands-on instruction in conducting deep-submergence vehicle-based field research, fostering integrative, multidisciplinary science, and optimizing the use of ship and vehicle technologies to maximize the scientific data collection and potential for significant results from this type of research, and training in communicating science via various social media outlets. All for early career scientists including post-docs. The project is supporting the following two broad objectives: (1) training and career development for the health and vitality of marine research; and (2)increasing inclusion and diversity in marine field science. The proposed program will provide many opportunities for participants to learn not only the logistics of developing and conducting a sea-going field expedition, but also have the opportunity to actively participate in conducting research at sea with a diversity of collaborators that cover the spectrum of volcanic, hydrothermal and biological phenomena at active mid-ocean ridge eruption sites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part II&lt;br/&gt;A cruise involving R/V Atlantis, along with deep- sea exploration vehicles Alvin and Sentry, has been funded and is planned for Dec. 3-20, 2018. The objectives of the cruise are to conduct four  Alvin and three Sentry AUV dives at the 8? 20?N seamounts, west of the East Pacific Rise (EPR) axis near 8? 20?N (a continuation of the Gregg/Fornari/Perfit/Wanless NSF-OCE-MGG funded research), and then to conduct four Alvin and four Sentry dives at the 9? 50?N eruption area, which will be the focus of Early Chief Scientist (ECS) Training that will involve 9-10 early career scientists (NSF-OCE-Facilities funded EAGER). The ECS Training includes: (1) Pre-cruise training via teleconference and webinars; (2) At-sea training which will include a synergic telepresence into the Fall 2018 American Geophysical Union (AGU); (3) A Post-cruise Forum and Outreach event in San Diego, CA on Dec. 22 that will invite local community colleges and high schools; and (4) Follow-up and Assessment of the ECS program and tracking of participant research in deep submergence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

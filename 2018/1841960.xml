<AbstractNarration>Underwater gliders are autonomous underwater vehicles that profile vertically by changing buoyancy while flying horizontally on wings. In the hands of a few expert groups, underwater gliders have proved to be fully operational. However, the technology is challenging for new users, limiting the impact of underwater glider observations on ocean sciences. The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop a next-generation underwater glider that will be accessible to a wider range of users. A critical step toward this goal is the transition to commercial production, sales, and customer support. An objective of this effort is to fashion a seamless transition from development to commercial availability. The anticipated outcome is a commercially available and supported Spray 2 underwater glider, with lowered barriers to entry for new users, and higher levels of support, documentation, and user-level software tools.  This will reduce the set of skills necessary to successfully operate the glider, and improve research outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A number of technical objectives will guide the development of the Spray 2 underwater glider. One of the factors holding back the wider use of gliders is the relative difficulty of service. A recurring issue with gliders, as with all oceanographic instruments, is the need for minor refurbishment and repair in the field. An objective of this effort is to ease servicing by making such components as batteries and sensors simpler to swap. Efficiency for gliders is surely achieved through missions with greater endurance. An objective is to enhance performance as measured by range through water. First-generation underwater gliders were designed to achieve long duration missions by limiting drag through a streamlined shape, and by moving slowly. The requirement for a smooth shape puts limitations on the sensor payload. Next-generation gliders will make the ability to carry sensors more central to their design. An objective of the development is to create a modular approach to the integration of new sensors, and to allow sensors to occupy locations on the glider with access to clean flow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

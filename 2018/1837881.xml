<AbstractNarration>This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) will advance the national health and security by addressing the supply chains that allow human trafficking to function effectively.  Human trafficking is one of the top revenue generators for illicit traders and has devastating effects on its victims, many of which are U.S. citizens.  By aiding the detection and disruption of the social, financial, and physical networks used by criminal organizations that traffic individuals, this research will help to limit their operations and funding, thereby enhancing national security.  Combating human trafficking will also have a positive impact on the lives of many youth, particularly females. The research outcomes will significantly advance the state of the art in social science and operations research. Insights from the research will be included in classes on operations research, human trafficking, illicit trade and transnational crime included in the programs of both the Schar School of Policy and Government and the Volgenau School of Engineering at George Mason University.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will use a multi-layered network approach that provides a systematic way to incorporate different types of data sources and multidisciplinary models into a holistic approach. The project combines social science methods with operations research methods to develop quantitative models that describe the complex operations of trafficking networks. The first phase will include analysis of existing and available data on human trafficking supply chains, transport logistics and financial transactions. To improve the detection of human trafficking, a new paradigm that enables the analysis of these multiple overlapping networks will be developed.  The analysis of data on available human trafficking cases will be published on the website of the Transnational Crime and Corruption Center at George Mason University and widely disseminated within the larger community of government, business and policy makers concerned with supply chains, human trafficking and illicit trade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

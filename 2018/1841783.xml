<AbstractNarration>EvaluATE is the evaluation learning and resource hub for NSF's Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program. This award will support EvaluATE's research, education, and network building activities, with the goal of enhancing the quality and impact of ATE workforce development projects. It is expected that higher quality evaluations will increase the potential of the evaluation results to inform practices in STEM workforce development.  The goals of this project are to: Expand the evidence base for effective science, technology, engineering and mathematics education evaluation practices; Improve ATE evaluators' knowledge and skills in evaluation; Improve the ability of ATE project personnel to use evaluation effectively (e.g., for improvement, understanding, and accountability of federally funded projects focused on workforce development); and increase professional exchange and strengthen connections among ATE evaluation stakeholders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will conduct four research studies with the overarching goal of improving the evaluation of federally supported projects.  Study 1 examines the validity of the ATE Evaluation Task Framework to guide the design and execution of rigorous project evaluation.  Study 2 investigates the procurement of evaluation services.  Study 3 explores the feasibility of measuring equity, diversity, and inclusion in the ATE context.  Study 4 examines evaluation in decision-making. Drawing on adult learning principles, the project will help ATE project evaluators and personnel to design conduct, manage, and use evaluation in their projects.  Building on existing strategies and resources, such as webinars and job aids, the project team plans to integrate and investigate fellowships and one-on-one technical assistance in evaluation capacity building.  Working with other ATE community and capacity building efforts, EvaluATE will facilitate development of a sustainable ATE evaluation network that includes evaluators and ATE practitioners.  This network has the potential to further strengthen the evaluation capacity of the ATE community and to enable rigorous evaluation of federally funded projects focused on workforce development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

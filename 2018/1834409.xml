<AbstractNarration>This grant provides financial support for the 18th US National Congress for Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (USNCTAM) to be held in Chicago, Illinois, June 5-9, 2018. USNCTAM is a premier gathering event for the theoretical and applied mechanics community that is held every four years under the auspices of the U.S. National Committee on Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (USNC/TAM). It fosters and promotes the exchange of ideas and information among the various disciplines of the theoretical and applied mechanics community around the world, and to chart future priorities in mechanics related research, applications, and education. This award will provide travel support as well as event support for students and young faculty, especially from underrepresented groups, such as minorities and women. Over a thousand attendees are expected to attend the congress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Consistent with the mission of the USNC/TAM, the congress organizers will: (1) provide partial travel support for undergraduate and graduate students and junior faculty to attend the meeting, and (2) organize two special events--the Young Investigator Career Development Workshop and the Women Researchers Networking Event, aimed at building communities. The organizers will reach out to historically black colleges and universities around the country as well as women and persons with disabilities in the field. The results of the meeting will be disseminated through the webpage of the USNC/TAM to its member societies and the engineering science community at large.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

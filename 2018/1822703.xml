<AbstractNarration>This award will support attendance by early-career scientists at the FASEB Conference Post-transcriptional Control of Gene Expression  - Mechanisms of RNA Decay to be held June 24-29, 2018 in Scottsdale, AZ. This is an evolving field powered by technological advances and fascinating discoveries on the role of RNA decay in controlling gene expression. Meeting objectives include: coalescing the field to disseminate latest research findings, providing an environment for establishing research collaborations, engaging a new generation of RNA decay researchers, and promoting professional development and networking. The meeting format includes keynote lectures by two leaders in the field, nine scientific sessions featuring a combination of invited lectures and talks selected from submitted abstracts, and three poster sessions. In addition, informal opportunities for engagement will be provided for junior researchers to learn from established investigators at a 'meet the speakers' lunch and a career and professional development panel discussion with senior researchers from both academia, industry, and government. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RNA decay plays a central role in regulation of gene expression, and this meeting will bring together a broad group of researchers in the field.  Meeting objectives include:  disseminating latest research findings, providing an environment for establishing research collaborations, engaging a new generation of RNA decay researchers, and promoting professional development and networking.  The size of the conference is expected to be small (100-150 attendees), which should enable productive discussions on an array of topics, including:  5' and 3' events in mRNA decay; translation-coupled mRNA decay; quality control mechanisms; small RNAs; regulation of RNA decay; ribonucleases; RNA decay in development and disease; and polyadenosine and other tails. The meeting will bring provide an excellent forum for junior investigators, including those from underrepresented groups, to hear about latest research in the U.S. and abroad, to meet and talk with leaders in the field, and to have an opportunity to present and receive feedback on their own research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>Climate warming in the Arctic has been 2-3 greater than in any other environment on Earth. There has been an increase in tundra wildfire occurrences in coastal Greenland in recent years, setting a new all-time record in summer 2017. A growing body of literature suggests that this increase in arctic wildfires is largely due to drier summer conditions from increasing temperatures, increasing length of the snow-cover free season, and increased lightning, all of which are linked to the arctic warming. This project focuses on the study of emissions from arctic tundra wildfires. Chemical tracers of wildfires, including carbon monoxide, methane, and a series of volatile organic compounds will be monitored in the atmosphere at the Greenland Environmental Observatory at Summit (GEOSummit), which, while considered one of the most pristine and remote locations in the Northern Hemisphere, has previously been shown to receive fire plumes from coastal Greenland and other arctic regions further away.  Observations will be applied in modeling research to assess the impacts of the increasing frequency and geographical extent of fires on the arctic environment and lower latitudes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will deliver continuous high time resolution data for wildfire emission and climate forcing atmospheric constituents at GEOSummit.  All data will be submitted to the Arctic Data Center for worldwide dissemination.  Data analyses and modeling will improve assessments of fire emissions and their environmental and climate impacts.  Results and interpretations will be presented in university class room teaching, seminars, at conferences, and in peer-reviewed journal publications.  Observations will make a pivotal contribution to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Global Atmospheric Watch (GAW) program. This research will also contribute to the following programs: Study of Environmental Arctic Change (SEARCH), Cryosphere and Atmospheric Chemistry (CATCH), Pollution in the Arctic: Climate, Environment and Societies (PACES), and the international Year of Polar Prediction (YOPP).  It addresses the need for ?long-term atmospheric measurements?, as stipulated in the Report on the Future of Atmospheric Chemistry Research to NSF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

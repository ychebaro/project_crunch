<AbstractNarration>Gamma-rays are the highest energy form of electromagnetic radiation.  Observations of astrophysical gamma-rays serve as probes of physical conditions and processes in the most extreme environments throughout the Universe and can be used to test fundamental physics. The Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS), located in southern Arizona, is designed to perform high-sensitivity pointed observations of both galactic and extragalactic sources.  This award supports scientists at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities in their research with VERITAS.  The group will participate in both technical operations in support of the observatory and scientific investigations of high energy gamma ray emission from active galaxies.  The University of Minnesota group is engaged in citizen science efforts to classify gamma-ray data through the Zooniverse.org platform.  The group will also engage undergraduates with VERITAS research experiences and participate in public outreach at local events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This University of Minnesota group will implement new analysis methods to improve the sensitivity of VERITAS to weak sources and to address systematic uncertainties at the highest energies.  With these improvements the group will perform scientific analyses of both new and archival VERITAS data to study Active Galactic Nuclei.  They will focus on characterizing new classes of very high energy emitting sources, including radio galaxies and extreme blazars to study the "blazar sequence."  They will also perform multi-wavelength studies on blazars to probe the gamma-ray emission zone and to set limits on the extragalactic background light through its effects on blazar intrinsic spectra.  In their work with Zooniverse.org, the group will crowd-source classifications of camera images, providing important training data for the improvement of image classification algorithms while at the same time engaging the public in gamma-ray related science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

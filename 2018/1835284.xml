<AbstractNarration>The Workshop  for Young Female Researchers addresses a challenge in speech science and technology: there are relatively few junior women researchers in the 'pipeline' to careers in speech. The goal is to foster interest in research in the field of speech by providing a venue where students in speech science and technology can present their work to each other and to senior women researchers, and where senior women can describe their own research and career experience to students and mentor them. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The workshop targets women undergraduate and masters students who are currently working in speech science and technology, who have had some research experience in their college and universities on individual or group projects in those areas, but who have not yet committed to getting a PhD in speech science or technology areas.  This 2018 workshop is the third annual meeting.  It  features panel discussions with senior female speech science and technology researchers, student poster presentations, and a mentoring session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>This renewal REU Site: Integrated Nanomanufacturing at Boston University (BU) will bring a diverse cohort of undergraduate students from universities and two-year colleges with limited research opportunities to engage in summer research in more than 30 potential interdisciplinary labs in Nanotechnology, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, Materials Science Engineering, and/or Mechanical Engineering at the BU Charles River campus. Nanomanufacturing research is an emerging interdisciplinary area at the intersection of nanotechnology and fabrication. Four thematic research areas will serve as the foundation for this renewal: 1. nanosystems that generate, sense, and manipulate, 2. nanofabrication of photonic and electronic nanostructures, 3. nanomaterials synthesis and characterization, and 4. nanophotonics neurophotonics and development of photonic devices. Nanotechnology seeks to develop and synthesize systems that manipulate, measure or control physical processes at the nanoscale, while integrated nanomanufacturing incorporates nanofabrication and materials research. This site is committed to offering an interdisciplinary and transformative experience to students from varying engineering disciplines that reflect the diversity of the mentors in Integrated Nanomanufacturing. The inclusion of REU participants working with startup companies in the Boston University Business Innovation Center is a new research opportunity in this REU site. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over a ten-week summer program, REU participants will be mentored and coached through a unique problem-based research experience, from basic skills building to open-ended discovery, with a focus on developing research independence.  Students will participate in mentored discovery, engineering of new devices, and fabrication at the nanoscale level to explore optical and integrated nanoscale systems, while developing critical skills, awareness and confidence necessary to advance along their career pathways in academics and research. Through this site, students will gain the opportunity to share their work with the research community at BU through presentations and to also submit to national conferences or co-author publications based on their research. The NSF REU Site in Integrated Nanomanufacturing will provide a site with the aim of educating members of the next generation of engineers in nanotechnology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

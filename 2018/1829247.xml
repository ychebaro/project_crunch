<AbstractNarration>This project, from the University of Louisville (UofL), creates a Type II NSF Innovation-Corps (I-Corps) Site. There are two types of I-Corps Sites. Type I Sites proposals are at institutions that have not had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. Type II Sites are at  institutions that have had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. I-Corps Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors. The UofL Site continues the integration of their commercialization infrastructure and capabilities through the collaborative efforts between the Office of the Executive Vice President for Research and Innovation (EVPRI), the College of Business' Forcht Center for Entrepreneurship (Forcht Center) and the institution's STEM programs.  The UofL I-Corps Site Program was established in 2015 and has provided entrepreneurial training, customer discovery and prototype development support to faculty, staff, students and alumni across the UofL. These efforts are focused on the commercialization of STEM discoveries resulting in increased regional economic development and entrepreneurship-trained faculty, staff, students and alumni. The UofL I-Corps Site program allows the University of Louisville innovation enterprise to recruit and engage STEM researchers and students at all stages of the entrepreneurial discovery process.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project leverages institutional research strengths and resources to enable students, faculty, staff and alumni to establish new ventures in emerging technologies and drive those ventures to successful milestones and exits. The University of Louisville is serving as a driver of the growth of high tech industries in Kentucky, a state that consistently lags other states in this regard. Phase II of the UofL's I-Corps Sites program implements a model of technology development that centers on entrepreneurial training and customer discovery as the foundation of product development. The program also focuses on collaborating with existing resources at UofL to focus on recruiting a diverse group of participants from under-represented groups in the STEM fields. The entrepreneurial training of students, faculty, staff and alumni will allow the state and region to recruit and retain the best and brightest researchers and entrepreneurs, thereby contributing to creating a culture shift across the state.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>The Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network (GLEON) conducts innovative science to understand, predict and communicate the role and response of lakes in a changing global environment. Each year GLEON holds an annual meeting to foster global science understanding about lakes. At the meeting scientists collaborate and share in training and mentoring among graduate students, early career scientists, and senior scientific leaders. They discuss the application of the science to citizens, lake managers, and regulators. Funding is provided for early career US scientists to participate in the annual meeting to be held in Perth, Australia in December 2018. The early career scientists will participate in building networks of collaborators, engage in science exchange, and design collaborative research projects. Training in collaboration, cutting-edge science methods, and teaching tools and approaches will occur. New scientific collaborations, syntheses, and publications will emerge for the early career scientists from the meeting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This annual GLEON meeting will provide early career scientists a unique opportunity to participate in a in leading-edge team-oriented global science, networking, mentoring, and training. GLEON has developed a highly productive meeting format to foster collaboration, creativity, and provide for intensive in-person meeting time to work on existing projects, assisting progress towards completion and strengthening ties among existing collaborators that lead to new projects and new collaborators. The early career scientists will benefit from networking and team building and scientific exchange and presentations. They will be trained in key collaboration, technical, and scientific skills such as collaboration and team science; data processing, modeling, and teaching using R software and distributed modeling approaches with undergraduate students. The scientists will gain experience in synthesis activities and publication preparation and designing new collaborative research projects. The early career scientists will gain key experience in working with international collaborative teams on large-scale synthesis projects, developing leadership skills and developing projects across cultural boundaries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

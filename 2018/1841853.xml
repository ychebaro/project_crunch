<AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, and the Biosensors and the Biological &amp; Environmental Interactions of Nanoscale Materials Programs in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems, Dr. Marco De Jesus and his group at the University of Puerto Rico - Mayaguez are mimicking nature to create a new generation of advanced, high performance, materials which interact with light in unusual and potentially useful ways.  In collaboration with the Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences (CNMS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the team is assessing the impact of detailed design on the performance of particle arrays for faster and more reproducible analysis of samples such as antimicrobials, emerging pollutants, and bioactive agents of biomedical and environmental significance.  Results of these studies may impact areas of national interest including the construction of solar cells, advanced optical sensors, and molecular probes. The project is providing interdisciplinary training and research opportunities to a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students in nanotechnology, chemical sensing, and bioanalytical chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to improve our current understanding of how nanomaterials interact with bioactive agents at the liquid/solid interface. Specifically, in collaboration with ORNL-CNMS, Dr. De Jesus and his team assess the efficiency of plasmonic responses on metallic surfaces as a function of nanoparticle morphology, interparticle spacing, and spatial resolution. They are particularly interested in the impact of these properties on the loading capacity and quantitative working range of these materials for chemical sensing applications. Using competitive binding experiments and multivariate Raman analysis, they seek to identify the structural dependence of surface interactions of mixed chemical agents to elucidate surface selectivity and trends for practical quantitation of mixtures. The successful completion of this project may provide new advances toward the rational design of nanomaterials with tailored properties for trace chemical analysis.  The work provides research and training opportunities for a diverse group of UPRM undergraduate and graduate students in nanotechnology applied to chemical systems, with direct exposure of the graduate students to state-of-the-art facilities at CNMS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>Surfaces such as those of pipes, trees or stones that are frequently covered in water are highly vulnerable to the growth of extensive films of bacteria. Even though bacteria grow on almost everything that is frequently in the water, furry mammals who live in and around the water of ponds rivers, streams and the ocean do not suffer from thick bacterial films on their fur. Extensive growth of bacteria causes "biofouling," when the bacteria interfere with the function of a man-made system.  The consequences of biofouling are of major concern as they include reduced hydrodynamic efficiency, reduced buoyancy, surface corrosion, flow blockage and contamination. The first bacteria that colonize a surface make a "primed surface" on which macroscale foulers (e.g., algae and barnacles) can congregate. It is the goal of this research to discover the combination of mechanisms that keep fur fouler-free. The study will address the commonly overlooked function of fur in mammalian survival, its ability to resist biofouling, thereby illuminating its role beyond insulation. A potential outcome of this research will be the discovery of new mechanisms to prevent to growth of bacteria on surfaces, which will further the economic goals of the United States by significantly reducing the need for surface maintenance for structures exposed to water. This work will enrich graduate and undergraduate curricula offered by the PI and Co-PIs. The project team will create an educational website, 'Hairy Tales,' to provide a platform for K-12 outreach related to this work. Focus will be given to providing research opportunities to minority students and students with diverse backgrounds via the University of Central Florida Office of Diversity and Inclusion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this research is the characterization of fur's resistance to biofouling by the consideration of its properties at various length scales, ranging from individual follicle texture and bending properties, to array morphology and aggregate texture. Fur's anti-fouling mechanisms will be characterized using representative furs from semi-aquatic and terrestrial mammals: North American beaver, river otter, sea otter, and caribou. By exposing these furs to three bacterial species that are common primary foulers, biofilm formation, persistence, and disruption will be measured and compared. Singular hairs submerged into liquid cultures containing proliferating bacteria will expose the possible effect of (1) fiber surface topology and (2) deformability on microbial attachment. Naturally arranged hides will (3) demonstrate the effectiveness of fiber-to-fiber contact to stunt bacterial proliferation and enable self-cleaning. Finally, (4) a fur's natural oils could impact fouler adhesion, which will be tested by comparing biofilm formation on untreated fibers to those cleaned of natural surfactants. These four experiments will unravel which physical mechanisms of fur predominately contribute to cleanliness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

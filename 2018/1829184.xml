<AbstractNarration>Characterization, Dynamics, and Biological Impact of Indoor Airborne Dust Exposure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Research Infrastructure for Science and Engineering (HBCU-RISE) program supports the development of research capability at Historically Black Colleges and Universities that offer doctoral degrees in science and engineering disciplines. Supported projects have a unifying research focus in one of the research areas supported by the National Science Foundation, a direct connection to the long-term plans of the host department, institutional strategic plan and mission, and plans for expanding institutional research capacity, as well as increasing the production of doctoral students, especially those underrepresented in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With National Science Foundation support, Texas Southern University will conduct a research project entitled "Characterization, Dynamics, and Biological Impact of Indoor Airborne Dust Exposure". This research focuses on two strategic directions: (1) collection, monitoring and chemical/biological characterization of indoor dust in correlation with local conditions, and (2) responses of model prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems to stress induced by indoor dust. This will form the basis for developing a statistical model able to identify patterns and predict trends in indoor air quality for locations typical to the Gulf Coast region. This study will also assist in determining whether exposure to chemical components of dust alters the expression of pro-inflammatory pathways in lung epithelial cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research outcomes will have a direct impact on local communities where the proposed environmental sampling and monitoring tasks will take place. The research outcomes will also advance current understanding of the contribution of outdoor air pollution to indoor air quality and biological responses. Spatial and temporal analysis of air quality data in a geographical region is essential for environmental and human health risk assessment. This project also aims to strengthen the doctoral Environmental Toxicology program at Texas Southern University. The program will benefit from (1) direct financial support to four doctoral students per year, (2) mentoring for graduate students to support their course preparation, effective teaching and learning, grant writing, and research, (3) summer internships for undergraduate students to advance research-based learning experiences and motivate them to pursue advanced degrees in STEM fields, and (4) enhancement of the Environmental Toxicology program curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

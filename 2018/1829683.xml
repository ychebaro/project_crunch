<AbstractNarration>The goal of this workshop is to highlight scientific opportunities that can address the energy challenges in nanoelectronics in general, as symbolized by the coming end of Moore's law. This is an emerging frontier of research in Condensed Matter and Materials Physics. Some representative opportunities include the following: Spintronic materials, Valleytronics, Topological materials, Quantum information / computation, Multiferroic materials, Quantum materials, Topological excitations such as magnetic skyrmions, Ionics and neuromorphic computation.  The workshop highlights the latest progresses in these diverse directions, identify major hurdles, milestones, metrics, as well as opportunities, and facilitate interactions across traditional research boundaries. It will also address research infrastructure needs and workforce development. Workshop participants will identify emerging challenges, obstacles and bottlenecks as well as future directions of research in the topical areas. A report will be prepared, with draft report written during the workshop, and distributed to the community and made available to general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

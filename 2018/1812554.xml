<AbstractNarration>Recent advances have enabled low-power radio and backscatter communication systems that enable Internet connected sensors and devices that can operate reliably for more than ten years. However, existing systems do not scale well with large-scale deployments of these devices. The project introduces algorithms that can decode thousands of concurrent transmissions from low-power radio and backscatter devices in city-wide wireless deployments. This enables wireless networks that operate at orders of magnitude lower latency and higher throughput and achieves sensor-networking infrastructure in cities that can potentially scale to millions of devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To this end, the proposal introduces a novel coding technique called distributed chirp spread spectrum modulation that works below the noise floor, operates on low-power radios as well as backscatter devices and can decode all concurrent transmissions at the receiver using a single FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) operation. The proposal addresses practical issues such as timing and frequency synchronization as well as the near-far problem given the extreme low power requirements of these devices. Finally, a test-bed of these low-power devices will be deployed and the feasibility of concurrent transmissions from hundreds to thousands of devices will be evaluated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>This project will develop a model system of a soft-robotic prosthetic designed to treat joint disease. Through the use of models of osteoarthritis progression and how mechanical loading impacts disease onset, progression, and regression, combined with models of continuous, compliant and configurable prosthetics, the research team will develop a soft-robotic prosthetic that is capable of responding in real time, based on implanted sensors, to the changing pressures of the joint while moving, such that the optimal dislocation will be achieved to promote healing. The research brings together two radically different concepts and approaches: (1) that the manipulation of mechanical forces can bring about regeneration of the knee cartilage and be curative for osteoarthritis, and (2) through the novel use of a robotic system, precise determination of forces and precise manipulation of the knee joint environment can occur to provide evidence of repair and regeneration of the knee joint.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team will evaluate knee osteoarthritis as their testbed, but the program could have far reaching capabilities for other musculoskeletal disorders like hip-related osteoarthritis, gait-dependent back pain, and other disorders that would benefit from dynamic input rather than static control. Development of an engineered bioactive soft-robotic brace would be transformative to the field of musculoskeletal regeneration, as it is unlike any previous attempt to treat osteoarthritis. The approach is non-invasive, responds dynamically to the physical loads imposed upon the joint, is informed by the actual extent of disease progression of the joint, and is highly cost-effective. The project is high-risk, but may create a new engineered paradigm for the treatment of one of the world?s most prevalent diseases. The results of this project will be shared amongst the greater research community through peer-reviewed publications, conference proceedings, podium presentations, and poster presentations, and as content of any invited chapters or reviews on topics germane to the work described.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>This project establishes the Cyberinfrastructure Network of Expertise (CNE) for teaching, training, and research on networking technologies including Science Demilitarized Zone (Science DMZ). The Science DMZ is a network specifically designed to facilitate the transfer and sharing of very large scientific data (big data) across geographically separated sites. The project serves the national interest, as it addresses the shortage of skilled research personnel with specialized skills to support networks carrying big science data among research institutions, universities, and national laboratories. This initiative also fosters skills toward the development of a national "cyber-highway" system to better facilitate the sharing of big science data, hence promoting collaboration and national competitiveness in science and engineering, aligned with NSF's mission. CNE is composed of universities, industry organizations, national and state agencies in multiple states, and a national laboratory. This broad initiative ensures a strong adoption of best cyberinfrastructure (CI) practices in sharing terabytes of data and more, thereby enabling new modes of discovery and collaboration. Additionally, the project develops advanced instructional material for Science DMZ, which is being integrated into undergraduate courses in information technology, computer science, and engineering in multiple universities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CNE is anchored at the University of South Carolina (USC) and has several thrusts. First, the instructional material is enriched with a large number of virtual laboratories (vLabs), designed in partnership with domain experts and the Network Development Group (NDG), a company in virtualized training. The material covers key aspects of the Science DMZ, including wide area networks, routers and switches, TCP attributes for big data transfers, and cybersecurity for friction-free environments. Second, the CNE partnership also includes Florida Atlantic University (FAU) and University of South Florida (USF), which are incorporating the vLabs and companion material into their degree programs. These enriched programs provide skills to fulfill pressing demands in both South Carolina and Florida. Third, in conjunction with local industry and Savannah River National Laboratory, CNE incorporates internships and industry-sponsored capstone projects in student training to strengthen the cooperation between academia and industry and to bolster national security related to big data transfers. Fourth, CNE organizes workshops to provide critical training and education on Science DMZs in partnership with Internet2 and state agencies, namely South Carolina Cyber (SC Cyber) and the Florida Center for Cybersecurity (FC2). Finally, by leveraging the extensive dissemination channels of all project partners, CNE plans to make vLabs and manuals available to the wider CI community for online self-paced self-training delivery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

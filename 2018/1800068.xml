<AbstractNarration>Polymers are among the most important building materials in the modern world. One class of polymer, polyolefins, comprises the largest fraction of industrial polymers. Despite their importance, polyolefins have some limitations that prevent even broader use. One of these limitations is the difficulty in expanding their physical and chemical properties beyond what is now known. For example, the introduction of chemical functionality will improve compatibility with other materials. In this project, Dr. Damien Guironnet of the University of Illinois is developing new catalytic strategies to enable the introduction of tunable, functional chemical groups within the polyolefin structure. Dr. Guironnet is actively engaging in outreach activities that build upon his research to promote student engagement in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. In particular, Dr. Guironnet is leading Chemical Engineering Department interactions with the St. Elmo Brady STEM Academy in Champaign, IL. This activity is improving the education of underrepresented primary school students and encouraging their interest in STEM careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Guironnet of the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign is developing a synthetic strategy to enhance the chemical tunability of polyolefins. The technical approach being investigated consists of performing a chain transfer polymerization technique using late transition metal catalysts and silane as chain transfer agents. The transformative aspect of this research is the ability to incorporate almost any molecule at the end of any polyolefin. The establishment of this strategy is paired with in-depth mechanistic studies of the chain transfer polymerization mechanisms. The undergraduate and graduate students involved with the project are gaining expertise in polymer science, catalysis and inorganic chemistry. This broad set of skills provides a unique training with great career opportunities. Dr. Guironnet is actively engaged in STEM outreach programs focused on the recruitment of African American boys in regional rural primary schools into the STEM fields in support of the broader impacts of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>In this project the researchers plan to develop a novel, new sensor package capable of measuring rates of aquatic carbon cycling. In the coastal and open ocean, rates of carbon cycling processes are not completely understood. This project will pave the way for future full-scale development of the sensor package that could substantially improve our confidence in the marine carbon cycle measurements and predictions for how the ocean may respond to human stressors in the future. The proposed work will advance the careers of two early career scientists. In addition, they plan to recruit undergraduate students through the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Summer Student Fellow Program, the semester at WHOI program, and the Woods Hole Partnership Program&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will develop a prototype sensor package to resolve technical challenges and conduct preliminary tests of the quantification of photosynthesis rates, bacterial respiration rates and quotients, and photochemical oxidation rates and quotients. The focus of this EAGER proposal will be on overcoming critical technical challenges in order to develop this prototype. The development work proposed will pave the road for future development and testing of a full-scale, deployable in-situ device. If successful they will develop a prototype of a first of its kind to sensing system to simultaneously measure the in-situ rates of photosynthesis, microbial respiration, and photochemical oxidation in any surface water. The risk areas are in the pumping and plumbing systems and mitigation of biofouling. They have been working on a number of ways to resolve these issues but will have to do a lot of testing to see what works best.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>This project will support attendance of young faculty, under-represented minority scientists, along with graduate students and post-docs at the 2018 Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) and Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Mitochondria and Chloroplasts to be held in Il Ciocco, Italy, July 7-13, 2018. The meeting will consist of short talks, poster sessions, communal dining, and conversations that will provide ample opportunity for sharing latest research results and for exploring collaborative possibilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mitochondria and chloroplasts are unique and crucial organelles of eukaryotic animal and plant cells as they produce the energy (ATP, NADH) cells need for their metabolism either by using high energy molecules (carbohydrates, fats, proteins) in the case of mitochondria, and sunlight in the case of chloroplasts.  Recent provocative findings in these fields, require that scientists come together to discuss these findings to move the fields forward. This meeting will provide opportunities for networking and sharing of research findings and approaches. For early career scientists and those new to the field, the meeting will provide important information relevant to a fast-moving area of research. Graduate students and post docs will be afforded ample opportunity to give oral as well as poster presentations which will assist their professional development. A 'Power Hour' presentation by senior female scientists will be followed by an open discussion on mentoring and support to ensure the professional growth of women in this STEM community. NSF funding will provide support for attendance by graduate students, post-docs and Assistant Professors with preference given to participants from underrepresented groups including minorities and women. Of note, the up-to-now confirmed program already includes 41% female presenters, the 2016 conference had 47% participants in their 20s and 30s, and the organizers are investing significant efforts to recruit minorities and persons with disabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quantum communication exploits the fundamental laws of physics to reliably secure private information networking even over untrusted channels. Despite rapid progresses in research and technology demonstrations, its large-scale deployment in practical settings still faces significant difficulties such as limited distance, low data rates, high susceptibility to channel disturbances, and disproportional operating overhead. This project aims to address those challenges by developing chip-integrated devices and sub-systems for preparation and detection of photonic signals in advantageous quantum states. They will be assembled to create innovative systems for line-of-sight applications robust against inferior weather conditions, ultra-efficient information encoding and decoding on single photons, and optimized hybrid quantum communication over both free space and optical fibers. This project will be carried out collaboratively by research groups from Stevens Institute of Technology and University of Texas at Arlington. Students from both institutes will be supported, motivated, and trained to work at the intersection of device integration, quantum optics, high-speed electro-optic circuits, and communication systems. A workforce with such balanced trainings and knowledge bases will contribute significantly to the industrial development of quantum technologies. At Stevens, a weekend-lab visit will be hosted each semester open to public to showcase the merging frontiers of quantum physics and nanophotonics. At Arlington, guided lab visits will be organized during the Engineering Week and K-12 summer camps. Both groups will continue to attract members from under-represented groups and help them launch scientific and engineering careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract:  &lt;br/&gt;This project will develop a highly-integrated quantum photonic platform based on lithium niobate thin films for modular quantum transceivers, whose unique capabilities include entanglement generation over 3.2-micron spectral spacing, lossless photon waveform shaping on a picosecond timescale, disruptive receiver technology based on mode-resolving photon detection, and ultrafast optical time-division de-multiplexing for fast quantum signals. With these offerings, this new device platform will host innovative techniques for fast, robust, and photon-efficient quantum communications over both telecom fibers and free space. Three quantum communication systems will be targeted in this project. The first is an innovative mid-IR channel for weatherproof quantum communication over free space, which not only multiplies the communication speed and reach but may also provide a reliable, high-speed ground-space link for quantum satellite applications through further development. The second is ultra-photon-efficient quantum key distribution using overlapping time-frequency modes to significantly increase the key rate while also strengthening the channel security. Meanwhile, quantum bit locking will also be explored by unitary scrambling and de-scrambling single photons, as an alternative approach to high-speed quantum encryption. The third is an optimized hybrid quantum key distribution system over free space and optical fibers that could form the basis for the future versatile, resilient quantum networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>In this project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamic &amp; Mechanism B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Susan Odom of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Kentucky is developing high-oxidation-potential organic compounds to serve as electro-active components of batteries with non-aqueous electrolytes, and to develop a library of shelf-stable and organic radical cation salts for use as chemical reagents.   The research could have significant impacts on overcharge protection of high-voltage cathodes in lithium-ion batteries.  It could also lead to more efficient preparation of active components of pharmaceutical values.   This project, which bridges organic, materials, and electro-chemistry, is poised to train students in highly collaborative research. Through annual Expanding Your Horizons Conferences, middle school girls with interest in STEM fields are the focus of outreach activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The reactivity of radical cations of conjugated organic compounds is difficult to predict, complicated by the combination of the electron deficient and radical nature of these singly oxidized species. Despite the numerous applications in which radical cations are used directly or appear as intermediates, progress in developing new materials is hindered due to the limited understanding of factors leading to stable oxidized states. Through the proposed research, this research group hopes to develop electro-active materials with stable radical cations and to extend the environments in which these species can be utilized.  In addition to more efficient compounds for overcharge protections in lithium-ion batteries and new reagents for organic synthesis, the research will elucidate reaction mechanisms of radical cations for a greater understanding of the stability and decomposition pathways of these electron-deficient species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

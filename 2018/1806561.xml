<AbstractNarration>The Standard Model of particle physics has been a remarkably successful theory, agreeing with several decades of experimental observations involving weak, electromagnetic, and strong interactions. The LHC discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 was further confirmation of this success.  However, the Standard Model remains an incomplete theory. This research will address some of the most intriguing and pressing questions in particle physics--what is the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking? What is dark matter? Are there extra spatial dimensions? In particular, the Higgs boson will be used to constrain the Standard Model and to probe for new physics. The research carried out through this award will exploit the excellent performance of the electromagnetic calorimeter of the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider facility at CERN in Switzerland to pursue strategically selected physics channels with common final states and analysis methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project combines important contributions to the CMS electromagnetic calorimeter with compelling physics studies in electron and photon final states, in addition to contributions to the operation, maintenance, and calibration of the CMS calorimeter, and involvement in the Phase-2 upgrade of the electromagnetic calorimeter electronics to fully exploit the opportunities at the High-Luminosity LHC. Through direct studies of the Higgs boson in the H-&gt;WW, H-&gt;gamma gamma, H-&gt;Zgamma channels, the question of electroweak symmetry breaking will be elucidated. Additionally, these channels will help constrain  new physics through indirect means. The group is also searching directly for new particles (via HH-&gt;bbgammagamma, h-&gt;aa-&gt;4photons) that may exist due to supersymmetry or extra dimensions. In addition, the study of di-Higgs production will probe the stability of the vacuum. This work also includes mentoring of women in physics at Northeastern University and engagement with undergraduates in research through the Northeastern cooperative education program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

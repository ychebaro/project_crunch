<AbstractNarration>Academic researchers need a simple data sharing architecture with end-to-end 10-to-100Gbps performance to enable virtual co-location of large amounts of data with computing. End-to-end is a difficult problem to solve in general because the networks between ends (campuses, data repositories, etc.) typically traverse multiple network management domains: campus, regional, and national.  No one organization owns the responsibility for providing scientists with high-bandwidth disk-to-disk performance. Toward the National Research Platform (TNRP), addresses issues critical to scaling end-to-end data sharing. TNRP will instrument a large federation of heterogeneous "national-regional-state" networks (NRSNs) to greatly improve end-to-end network performance across the nation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of improving end-to-end network performance across the nation requires active participation of these distributed intermediate-level entities to reach out to their campuses. They are trusted conveners of their member institutions, contributing effectively to the "people networking" that is as necessary to the development of a full National Research Platform as is the stability, deployment, and performance of technology. TNRP's collaborating NRSNs structure leads to engagement of a large set of science applications, identified by the participating NRSNs and the Open Science Grid. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TNRP is highly instrumented to directly measure performance. Visualizations of disk-to-disk performance with passive and active network monitoring show intra- and inter-NSRN end-to-end performance. Internet2, critical for interconnecting regional networks, will provide an instrumented dedicated virtual network instance for the interconnection of TNRP's NRSNs. Cybersecurity is a continuing concern; evaluations of advanced containerized orchestration, hardware crypto engines, and novel IPv6 strategies are part of the TNRP plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

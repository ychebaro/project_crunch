<AbstractNarration>Recently, researchers in the field of engineering have begun to turn toward understanding how an inclusive education model can help engineering programs increase the number of students that are retained and graduated from their undergraduate engineering programs.  Previous research studies have demonstrated that educators' beliefs about student abilities matter for student success. Research has also shown that effective teaching methods and learning environments can facilitate authentic learning experiences in which students are actively engage, seek deeper meaning, understanding, and real-life applications of the course material.  This has been linked to higher student test scores, retention, and graduation rates.  What has been investigated to a lesser extent is how the beliefs of faculty members influence teaching methods, learning environments, and teacher genuineness.  Some recent studies consider how faculty instructional choices and interactions transform engineering education environments into one that is more inclusive.  Characterizing the correlation between faculty members' belief regarding academic abilities and teaching methods, learning environment, and teacher genuineness can broaden our understanding of inclusive teaching practices within undergraduate engineering programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study is grounded in the construct of fixed verse growth mindset as defined by Carol S. Dweck.  Individuals with a fixed mindset attribute intelligence to fixed traits and those with a growth mindset attribute intelligence to learning, effort, training, and practice.  Specifically, our research will explore the overall research question: How does the faculty mindset impact instructional practice, learning environments, and teacher authenticity? In this study, faculty mindset is defined as faculty views of student intelligence.  The study investigated how the way faculty views of student intelligence can foster a climate and culture of inclusivity and diversity.  Understanding these relationships can have implications in terms of identifying potential barriers to success of students from a variety of backgrounds, learning styles, and abilities.  This study will lay the foundation to inform improvements in engineering teaching and learning by broadening the engineering education research agenda to include growth mindsets that translate from engineering faculty to students.   This research will illuminate strategies to foster a climate and culture of inclusivity and diversity that will improve teaching and learning in engineering to positively impact all student populations, including those traditionally underrepresented in engineering.  The results of the study will produce recommendations for faculty, student support programs, and administrators who can directly implement new approaches to engineering pedagogy and learning strategies that improve academic achievement, engagement, and broadening participation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>At its core, the National Science Foundation's CSforAll initiative has the goal of creating the&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure, pathways, and incentives that develop ecosystems for supporting and motivating all youth&lt;br/&gt;to become computationally literate and pursue computer science-related degrees and careers. This&lt;br/&gt;proposal makes a case for the extension of the CSforAll infrastructure to include the integration of out-of-school time (OST) learning projects into existing CSforAll funded grants by asking two questions: How&lt;br/&gt;can we foster a community learning environment that recognizes, supports, and promotes computational&lt;br/&gt;literacies as a desirable and accessible form of social capital by mentors, youth, and families? And how&lt;br/&gt;do these community-level connections impact youth computational making learning opportunities,&lt;br/&gt;participation, social networks, knowledge, and understanding? In Evanston, a partnership between&lt;br/&gt;Northwestern University, the district, and the Evanston YMCA will work together to understand and answer these&lt;br/&gt;questions by designing and operating a community-based computational making OST hub that provides&lt;br/&gt;the learning activities and peer community needed to create an inviting and relevant environment for&lt;br/&gt;students, caring adults, and educators to reorient their perception towards computer science-related&lt;br/&gt;careers as desirable and achievable for youth in the community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks to take advantage of a unique opportunity - the launch of a 1:1 middle grades tablet&lt;br/&gt;initiative in a racially and socioeconomically diverse community actively engaged in addressing their&lt;br/&gt;expanding achievement gap - to implement a community-based computational making OST hub and&lt;br/&gt;reimagine how a community-embedded approach to OST designed to support youth and caring adults&lt;br/&gt;(parents and mentors) can ignite youths' computational making participation. Specifically, this proposal&lt;br/&gt;seeks to create a learning community that uses the computational thinking guided design process to&lt;br/&gt;motivate and support students in the systemic creation of interactive objects that require the&lt;br/&gt;integration of coding, digital fabrication, and visual design literacies to produce aesthetically powerful&lt;br/&gt;and socially conscious solutions to student and community defined design challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

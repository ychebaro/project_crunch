<AbstractNarration>The importance of microstructures in Material Science is well  recognized. Their local and global geometry influence the functional  behaviors of the materials being designed in a major way.  Therefore,  methodologies for their controlled manufacturing have always been a  focus of intense research. Now, with continuing advancements in  characterization of materials at higher resolution and faster time  scales there is intensified need for data driven digital simulation  and analysis of structure. This project focuses on leveraging the new  area of topological data analysis in advancing the design of  templated microstructure designs through a collaboration between  material and data scientists at Rutgers University and data  scientists at the TRIPODS center at Ohio State University. Templating  is the ideal topical area for this collaboration because it so  definitively directs shape development during processing and can  benefit greatly from deeper topological and statistical analytics.  The researchers will develop a topology-related synergy between Materials  Science, Computer Science, and Statistics that will enable improved  processing of materials using templating. The geometrical and  topological advances developed in this program are expected to also  be extensible to other areas of materials processing, each of which  has unique shape novelty, alignment effects, or texture development.  The project's work could also benefit a range of similar application fields  such as medical image analysis, computational neuroanatomy,  geographic information systems, and engineering designs. Indeed,  collaborations to apply geometric/topological methods to some of  these other application fields are already underway at the TRIPODS  center at OSU and could benefit from close collaboration with this  Materials-focused program as it develops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research involves concepts from mathematical areas  of algebraic topology and geometry, applied statistics, and  computational areas of algorithms and graph theory. These will be  applied to materials microstructures created by templating to help  understand topological interconnections, shapes, and dynamics, which  would be of benefit to functional improvements in device operation.  Research in topological data analysis has brought forth the need to  investigate topological concepts in the presence of finite data,  approximations, and noise, constraints that are always encountered in  real materials characterization. Geometric and topological  computation with intentionally structured materials will yield big  and diverse data that can influence and improve future material and  device fabrication efforts. These new data methods will be of  interest to the topological and statistical communities as well as  open up new avenues for predicting and intentionally creating  structures with enhanced functionality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

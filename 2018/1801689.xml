<AbstractNarration>This project supports research in algebraic geometry (which studies solutions to systems of polynomial equations in many variables). This subject is thousands of years old, and provides a systematic language for translating statements in geometry (such as "a doughnut is more curved than a ball") to those in algebra (such as "an elliptic function field is not rational"). A dominant theme of this project is to use this dictionary to better understand the variation in the geometric structure of a solution set of a certain system of equations as one perturbs the coefficients of the defining equations, especially in an arithmetic sense (i.e., in passing from usual arithmetic to modular or ``clockwork'' arithmetic). A better understanding of the geometric structure of solution sets of equations in modular arithmetic is fundamental to many applications of mathematics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI shall study the interaction between techniques coming from number theory (such as cohomology theories in p-adic Hodge theory) and algebraic topology (such as topological Hochschild homology) in the context of algebraic varieties over a p-adic field. A deep relationship between the two is expected: they should be related in the same way that motivic cohomology and algebraic K-theory are related (i.e., via an Atiyah-Hirzebruch type spectral sequence). The PI shall also use tools coming from number theory and p-adic geometry (such as perfectoid geometry) to approach problems in commutative algebra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

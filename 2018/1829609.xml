<AbstractNarration>Educating a well-prepared STEM workforce is a national priority that underlies progress in science and contributes to national prosperity.  A contemporary challenge for colleges and universities is the need to accelerate adoption of effective teaching and learning practices at scale and to create inclusive learning environments.  Meeting this challenge involves preparing current and future faculty members to create more inclusive STEM learning environments. The proposed project will fund the sixth National Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching, and Learning (CIRTL) Forum.  CIRTL is a network including 41 major research universities that are committed to transforming STEM undergraduate education through innovative approaches that prepare future STEM faculty members for careers of both research excellence and evidence-based teaching.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This two-day gathering will have approximately 400 attendees and is designed to foster professional development and networking among current faculty, future faculty, and administrators focused on improving undergraduate STEM education.  Targeted invitations and speaking opportunities will focus on: shifting the conversation on graduate education towards training doctoral students to be effective undergraduate STEM instructors; promoting diversity in STEM through evidence-based pedagogy; and change leadership in undergraduate STEM education.  The event is designed to create significant opportunities for idea exchange, networking, and learning about best practices. Workshop assessment will be conducted using pre- and post-event surveys designed to identify participant interests and understanding of meeting-related topics.  The ultimate goal is to enhance the professional development and future work of all participants towards promoting effective teaching and learning of all STEM undergraduates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

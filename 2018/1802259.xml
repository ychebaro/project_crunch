<AbstractNarration>In mid-September of 2018, the first of three Southeastern Number Theory Meetings planned for the 2018-2019 academic year will take place at either Davidson College in Davidson, NC, or at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, NC.  The local host at Davidson will be Mike Mossinghoff; if the meeting is at Wake Forest University, the local hosts will be Jeremy Rouse and Abbey Bourdon.  The University of South Carolina in Columbia, SC will host the second meeting on the first weekend of December 2018.  The third meeting is tentatively planned for April 2019 at Armstrong State University in Savannah, GA.  The local hosts will be Sungkon Chang and Duc Huynh. While Armstrong State has expressed enthusiasm for hosting the meeting, the location of the Southeastern Number Theory Meetings is traditionally decided at the previous year's meeting. Further information on these meetings including the locations, dates, lists of speakers, lists of participants, and registration information will be linked to the conference home pages as it becomes available: http://www.math.sc.edu/~boylan/seminars/pantshome.html and  http://www.math.clemson.edu/~kevja/SERMON. The meetings consist of participant talks on current research in all areas of number theory, including analytic number theory, arithmetic geometry, and automorphic and modular forms. These topics reflect the research interests of number theorists working in the Southeast.   Each meeting features plenary talks by nationally and internationally recognized leaders in the field, invited talks by graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, and a larger number of contributed talks by mathematicians at all levels including undergraduate and graduate students, and junior and senior faculty.  Number theorists from outside the Southeast will give the invited and plenary talks, while regional researchers will give most of the contributed talks.     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A primary goal of the Southeastern Number Theory Meetings is to provide members of the number theory community in the Southeast with an opportunity to learn about new and significant research in number theory and to disseminate their own research.  Students and junior researchers in the community particularly benefit from the meetings. The meetings strengthen their knowledge base, expose their work to a wider audience, and give them insightful input and feedback from other participants.  Funding from the NSF allows the organizers to achieve their goals at a low cost to individual participants.  These meetings integrate regional mathematicians into the community who may have little or no funds for professional travel such as graduate students and faculty at institutions that do not award Ph.Ds.  The organizers will continue efforts to attract a demographically diverse participant base including women and racial and ethnic minorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

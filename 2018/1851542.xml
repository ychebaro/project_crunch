<AbstractNarration>This REU site conducts a nationwide recruitment effort to target talented undergraduates, particularly those with limited opportunity for research at their home institutions. They are brought for 8 summer weeks to SDSU's campus, where they are intermixed with undergraduates from other institutions, visiting faculty, the co-PI, and the PI. In this environment, they are trained in the  experience of being a research mathematician. They read background papers, write code to formulate conjectures, prove theorems, write papers, collaborate with peers, and present their results in seminars and at conferences. They also learn about graduate school and the career as a whole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU site will train twelve undergraduates per summer in mathematical research, from problem genesis to production of submitted papers.  For eight weeks, students will meet daily with faculty project directors, produce conjectures, prove theorems, and write a manuscript (in LaTeX) with their results.  The PI and Co-PI are experts in nonunique factorization, numerical semigroups, and various adjacent mathematical disciplines.  They have substantial experience in publishing with student coauthors, and anticipate such publications in peer-reviewed mathematics journals of international reputation as an outcome of this program.  Experts will join the team (in years 2 and 3) to supplement expertise and assist in choosing problems and in directing projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

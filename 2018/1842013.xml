<AbstractNarration>Roadtrip Nation LTD (RTN) will produce the Computer Science (CS) Innovation Roadtrip, which will leverage RTN's multimedia content deliverables, evidence-based educational resources, and peer-to-peer student engagement strategies in order to increase the number and diversity of the nation's underrepresented high school students interested in pursuing computer science education and computing careers. At the same time, this project aims to shift perceptions among adult stakeholders, broadening their views on computing and the computing workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Founded in 2001, RTN is an award-winning media and education organization that empowers students to define their own roads in life through a public television series, live campus events, an online content database, and innovative educational resources that serve an audience of 14 million students each year. The CS Innovation Roadtrip will focus RTN's content development and programmatic capacity on highlighting the stories of diverse individuals who are driving innovation across the computing disciplines. These interviews, conducted by students, will be produced by the RTN production team for distribution across a variety of media and education networks, including RTN's documentary series on public television (presented by KQED), the Roadmap to Careers tool in collaboration with The College Board (reaching all Scholastic Aptitude Test and Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test takers), and via a partnership with the National Center for Women and Information Technology (NCWIT) Alliance network. Where appropriate, the educational materials and approaches developed as part of the CS Innovation Roadtrip will map to the Computer Science Teachers of America educational standards, Next Generation Science Standards, Common Core State Standards, and the Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles curricular framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for US participation in the conference "Spring Mini Course in Analysis and Geometry" that will be held February 8-11, 2018 at the Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, USA.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the fields of harmonic analysis and geometric analysis.   A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference.  This award gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF and the like an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference.   The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities.

<AbstractNarration>Machine learning has been adopted by a broad range of emerging applications, including health monitoring, autonomous driving, advanced manufacturing, etc. However, any machine learning system cannot be 100% accurate due to the accuracy limitation posed by machine learning algorithms and the circuit-level non-ideal features associated with its hardware implementation. This project investigates a radically new framework for efficient validation of machine learning systems implemented with nano-scale integrated circuits. It aims to identify and synthesize the critical corner cases for which a machine learning system is likely to fail. The project is expected to initialize a paradigm shift in today's design methodology for complex machine learning systems, thereby leading to an immediate impact on a broad range of industrial sectors relying on machine intelligence. In addition, the proposed education activities create a large number of unique training opportunities for both academic and industrial participants, substantially improving the education infrastructure and generate high-quality researchers and practitioners for the society. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today, validating a machine learning system with high throughout, low power and complex functionality is an extremely challenging task. This project attacks the grand challenge by developing a novel validation framework composed of two major components: (1) corner-case generation and (2) rare-failure rate estimation. Both physical circuit models and statistical generative models are proposed to synthesize a large amount of test cases, reducing the experimental cost to physically record the corner-cases that are difficult to observe. Furthermore, a novel formulation, based on subset partition and graph embedding, is developed to efficiently inspect the likely-failed test cases and consequently estimate the rare- failure rate that is expensive to capture by random sampling. Built upon these mathematical tools, the project's framework offers a fundamental infrastructure that could facilitate radical breakthroughs over numerous machine learning applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

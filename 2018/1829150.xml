<AbstractNarration>This project establishes an I-Corps Site at Saint Louis University (SLU). Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to accomplishing the goals of I-Corps, SLU specifically engages groups that are underrepresented in STEM and entrepreneurial activities through expanding collaborations with historically black Harris-Stowe State University, which adjoins the SLU campus. Leveraging existing shared-degree pathways, these collaborations offer significant opportunities for broader impact through the development and export of best practices. The location of the SLU I-Corps Site at the Center of Research Technology and Entrepreneurial Exchange (Cortex) solidifies connections to a variety of regional innovation and commercialization facilities, resources and networks. The SLU I-Corps site motivates faculty and student researchers to think beyond the laboratory or classroom, capitalizing on the university's strengths in entrepreneurship education.  SLU trains participants to test the market for their innovative ideas, training and mentoring teams to encourage startup businesses. I-Corps also positions SLU as a commercialization partner for industry, entrepreneurs, and agencies in the St. Louis and broader Midwest regions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>Atomic clocks are the most accurate devices ever made by mankind, and they have many important technological applications. This project aims to significantly improve the precision of atomic clocks and other quantum devices such as atom interferometers. It will promote the progress of science by advancing the understanding of quantum mechanics and its potential technological applications. In this project, research and educational goals will be united by training undergraduate and graduate students in atomic physics research methods.  This project will also help to increase the participation in physics; in particular, three students from underrepresented backgrounds in science will complete their Ph.D.s working on this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major frontier of physics is the control of non-classical states of many-body systems. Such control will enable novel quantum devices, and improve atomic precision measurements beyond the standard quantum limit through entanglement. The present project focusses on using light to manipulate and entangle atomic systems consisting of thousands to millions of atoms. The major goals are to create quantum degenerate Bose and Fermi gases purely by optical cooling, to generate highly entangled states of many atoms using light, and to demonstrate atom interferometers operating well beyond the standard quantum limit, and close to the Heisenberg limit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>This project support student and early career travel to the 9th International GEOS-Chem Meeting (IGC9). The GEOS-Chem Meeting is held at Harvard every two years and is a major event for the global atmospheric chemistry modeling community, with about 200 attendees and a very broad range of topics.  GEOS-Chem is an open-source global 3-D model of atmospheric composition used actively by over 150 research groups around the world, including 52 in the US.  This meeting will bring together experts to exchange information that will inform and stimulate fundamental research in modeling of atmospheric composition with links to climate dynamics, biogeochemistry, and air quality.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Applications of GEOS-Chem span a very wide range of atmospheric composition problems including oxidants, aerosols, carbon gases, stratospheric chemistry, mercury, persistent organic pollutants, and others. GEOS-Chem links with Earth System Models for studies of chemistry-climate-ecosystem interactions, with meteorological data systems for chemical data assimilation, with regional models for air quality applications, and with assessment models for policy applications.  The GEOS-Chem model is centrally managed at Harvard with guidance from a Steering Committee including 17 US university professors.  A GEOS-Chem Support Team based at Harvard, University of Colorado, and Dalhousie University is responsible for model development, benchmarking, documentation, communication, and education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

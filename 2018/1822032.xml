<AbstractNarration>This National Science Foundation award provides partial support for the 52nd Spring Topology and Dynamical Systems Conference (STDC) to be held at Auburn University, in Auburn, AL, March 14-17, 2018. This latest installment of a successful conference series hosted for the fifth time by Auburn began in 1967 at Arizona St  and will feature invited talks from some of the world leading experts in fields related to topology, including exciting new applications.  The conference brings together researchers from a wide array of topics to interact and share ideas. The conference involves researchers at all career stages and features extended workshops on exciting, developing areas of Topology in a way that should bring in new researchers. Additionally, there will be Special Sessions with speakers who are renowned experts together with graduate students and young researchers. A special effort is made to involve women and researchers from underrepresented groups. To further disseminate the findings discussed at the conference, the long running, peer-reviewed journal Topology Proceedings will publish a volume dedicated to the conference.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Spring Topology and Dynamics Conference (STDC) is an annual conference that typically attracts between 150 and 200 participants. The Special Sessions this year will be on Algebraic Topology, Continuum Theory, Dynamical Systems, Geometric Group Theory, Geometric Topology and Set-Theoretic Topology, and one of the invited talks will focus on the application of topology to data science. As such, the conference provides a platform for researchers with a variety of interests to forge new links and to find new applications of topology. The grant provides funds to support travel for invited speakers, graduate students and researchers without external support. More information about the conference can be found on the web site http://www.auburn.edu/~kuperkm/STDC2018/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

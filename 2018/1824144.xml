<AbstractNarration>The PI's requests funding to design, construct, and test a new instrument setup that will allow measurements of air-water gas exchange in shallow-water marine environments. This effort will benefit a large and broad group of aquatic scientists who use gas exchange estimates in their ecosystem studies. In addition, undergraduate and graduate students will be trained in high-frequency data acquisition with complex instruments and analysis of "big data" produced within this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI's will design, construct, and test a new instrument setup that will allow this new application of the aquatic eddy covariance technique in shallow-water marine environments.  This will be accomplished by applying their aquatic eddy covariance technique right below the air-water interface to measure air-water gas exchange. If successful, the new instrument setup will significantly improve the accuracy of gas exchange measurements for shallow-water marine systems, and as important, enhance the temporal and spatial resolution of these measurements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the "Third Midwestern Microlocal Meeting: Microlocal Analysis, Inverse Problems and Resonances" held at Purdue University from March 22 to 24, 2019. The involvement of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in any scientific meeting is extremely important; this is one way scientific knowledge gets transmitted from one generation to the next. The award gives early-career researchers, researchers who are members of underrepresented groups, and researchers without other sources of support a chance to attend lectures and interact with the invited speakers and with each other. This will expose junior mathematicians to an exciting and dynamical mathematical environment and will motivate and encourage them to continue working on mathematical research. The topics of the conference are closely related to questions that are of interest in physics, such as mathematical resonances, scattering, the long-time behavior of waves, and inverse problems. Participants will be exposed to these possible applications, potentially leading to future developments in medical imaging, geophysics, and other interdisciplinary subjects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The topics discussed in the meeting belong to the field of mathematical analysis, and include scattering theory, inverse scattering, resolvent estimates, resonances, inverse problems, and generalized Radon and X-ray transforms.  The conference will help disseminate recent results and contribute to future developments in these fields.

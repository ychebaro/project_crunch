<AbstractNarration>This award is for a  conference which will survey the state of the art in one of the dominant paradigms in mathematics -- the Langlands program. These conjectures and partial results began as a set of elegant relationships between number theory and harmonic analysis, and have driven progress on many stunning results across a wide range of mathematics over the last half century. The conference will be held on November  14-16, 2018, at the Institute for Mathematics and its Applications (IMA) at the University  of Minnesota. Detailed program information can be found at the conference website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;https://www.ima.umn.edu/2018-2019/SW11.14-16.18&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Themes for the lectures include recent advances in the trace formula; Eisenstein series and L-functions; local, geometric, and p-adic versions of the Langlands program; Shimura varieties; and endoscopy and beyond. The speaker list is comprised of many of the world experts in aspects of the Langlands program, and was determined by the scientific organizing  committee of James Arthur, William Casselman, Geir Ellingsrud, and Freydoon Shahidi. The event presents a unique opportunity for the next generation of mathematical researchers to learn modes of possible progress on this fundamental collection of conjectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

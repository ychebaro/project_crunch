<AbstractNarration>This project is devoted to research on dynamical systems that represent mathematical models of complex physical systems evolving over time. Dynamical systems of interest include mechanical systems (e.g., motion of satellites under the influence of gravity, solar pressure, electromagnetic forces, etc.), astrophysics system (e.g., expansion of the early universe, motion near a Black Hole, and evolution of exoplanetary systems), and high energy physics (e.g., particle accelerators, and plasma confinement devices). The goal of this research is to analyze and predict patterns of complex behavior emerging from the dynamics, and to obtain statistical information on the long-term evolution of the underlying systems. The obtained results are expected to contribute towards advancing scientific discovery and promoting innovative technologies, for example to design more efficient satellite orbits, to optimize performance of particle accelerators, and to understand more about the formation and evolution of the universe and of our solar system. Additionally, this project integrates research with education, and contributes towards preparing a diverse, highly qualified mathematics workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the fundamental level, the mathematical models to be investigated by this project can be framed in the formalism of Hamiltonian dynamics. A quintessential question is to understand the long-term behavior of orbits in Hamiltonian systems. This question is investigated in the context of nearly-integrable Hamiltonian systems (the Arnold diffusion problem), in the context of the N-body problem, and in the context of randomly perturbed Hamiltonian systems. The main objective of the research is to obtain qualitative and quantitative information on typical orbits in such systems. The information of interest concerns the distance traveled, speed and stability of orbits, the measure/Hausdorff dimension of the set of initial conditions for orbits that visit a prescribed sequence of targets, and the statistical distribution of orbits evolving from an initial data set.  For this purpose, the investigator and his colleagues develop innovative methodologies that combine geometric, topological, and statistical methods, which can be applied to concrete examples, and can be implemented in high-precision numerical computations and computer assisted proofs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

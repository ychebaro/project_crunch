<AbstractNarration>This project continues the long-running Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program at DIMACS, the Center for Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey. The program exposes students to a broad range of computer science topics emphasizing the theory and use of algorithms applied in contexts that range from bioinformatics to big data. The program includes projects led by Rutgers faculty from several disciplines, involves graduate students as assistant mentors, and combines with other REU programs that add cultural diversity and an international element through partnership with the DIMATIA center in Prague.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program draws on the traditional strengths of DIMACS in theoretical computer science, mainly focused on algorithms and complexity. Student research spans both theory and applications showcasing algorithms in settings that include, among others, big data analytics, privacy and cybersecurity, bioinformatics, and robotics. The majority of the projects address algorithmic foundations, including projects on complexity, machine learning, coding theory, and analysis of algorithms for streaming and privacy. Additionally, the program leverages DIMACS' position as an interdisciplinary center to involve mentors from various academic departments to offer students varied perspectives and projects whose applications cross disciplines to illustrate the power of computing in a variety of settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>This award provides partial support for the OceanObs' 19 Conference in Honolulu, Hawaii, on September 16 - 20, 2019. OceanObs' 19 is the next in the series that started in 1999 and is held every 10 years. This conference will provide an important platform for the international ocean community to coordinate and exchange information and plan for future efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial support for the OceanObs' 19 Conference in Honolulu, Hawaii, on September 16 - 20, 2019. OceanObs' 19 is the next in the series that started in 1999 and is held every 10 years. The OceanObs' 99 conference in St. Raphael, France resulted in an internationally coordinated system for physical climate and ocean carbon observations. The OceanObs' 09 conference held in Venice, Italy expanded the range of communities working together to undertake more comprehensive and sustain ocean observations and led to the Framework for Ocean Observing. The OceanObs' 19 conference encompasses the potential to build on the success generated by the Framework for Ocean Observing and will seek to better connect observers with end user communities. The Framework for Ocean Observing is meant to guide the ocean observing community as a whole to establish an integrated and sustained global observing system. The conference program highlights seven vital societal benefit themes: Discovery, Ecosystem Health and Biodiversity, Climate Variability and Change, Water Food and Energy Security, Pollution and Human Health, Hazards and Maritime Safety, and Blue Economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation project supports the acquisition of a tabletop high-resolution scanning electron microscope at York College of the City University of New York (York College/CUNY). The acquired scanning electron microscope is used in a wide range of fields including chemistry, geology, environmental science, and pharmaceutical science; it enables the training of undergraduate and master's students in the fundamental principles of scanning electron microscopy, and enhances the curriculum activities for pre-service teachers by providing them with advanced skills and curriculum content. The tabletop scanning electron microscope is also part of a substantial growth plan for a new Master's program at York College and a key instrument for expanding and improving research and training activities that are highly beneficial for York College students in the science disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;The tabletop high-resolution scanning electron microscope enables compositional and topographical analysis of metals, nanoparticles, pharmaceutical materials, and biomaterials. It is used in multidisciplinary research projects such as 1) elucidation of the crystallization processes of materials, 2) investigation of metal contamination in aquifers, 3) elucidation of molecular mechanisms of amyloid formation from mutant peptides, and 4) study of the anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory effects of nanoparticles in their interactions with biological systems. The instrument can perform at a 1-30 kV accelerating voltage range; it is equipped with backscatter and secondary electron detectors, an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer, and a variable aperture that can provide a similar resolution to some full-size systems. The low costs of maintenance, the modest infrastructural requirements, and the excellent ease-of-use make the instrument a convenient and versatile analytical tool for York College faculty members and other researchers, who mostly rely on undergraduate students for their research projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

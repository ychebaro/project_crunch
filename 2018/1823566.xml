<AbstractNarration>The National Science Foundation-owned research vessel R/V Oceanus has been successfully operated by Oregon State University (OSU) since 2012.  This award represents year-1 of a five ?year renewal cooperative agreement.  The vessel has sailed throughout the Pacific Basin in support of a wide variety of peer-reviewed projects for NSF, as well as the Office of Naval Research, and other Federal and State agencies.  Oceanus supported much of this work due to the vessels operational versatility, economic efficiency and the ability to work both in the near shore environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seagoing research planned for 2018 is expected to cover a wide range of disciplines.  Schedules cruise will scientists understand the hydrographic parameters of the oceans as well as various chemical processes associated with marine sediments and oxygen minimum zones (OMZ).  Other studies will focus on chemistry, inner shelf dynamics, and other physical characteristics that should ultimately increase the body of knowledge around such varied topics as benthic infauna, animal physiology, and underwater sound propagation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With 181 planned operating days on the CY 2018 schedule, the ship will work from the Gulf of Mexico, the Bering Sea and the West Pacific Coast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

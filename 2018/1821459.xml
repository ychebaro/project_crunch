<AbstractNarration>Computer science includes abstract, high-level concepts as well as concrete details, such as the proper arrangement of code. As a result, teaching computer science is particularly challenging. Pencil puzzles show promise for learning computer science, as well as for promoting critical and computational thinking and problem solving. This project builds on a previous analysis that demonstrated the effectiveness of pencil puzzles in introductory computer programming courses.   It aims to aims to extend the assessment to multiple course levels and to multiple institutions that have different characteristics and student demographics. Pencil puzzles are diagrams that pose a problem that humans solve through deduction, using only a pencil. Most pencil puzzles are language and culture independent, giving them broad potential as a teaching and learning tool. The use of pencil puzzles to teach computer science principles has the potential to broaden participation in computing. This project seeks to provide insights into the puzzles' effects on learning, engagement of diverse populations, suitability for both K-12 and upper division computational thinking courses, and value to instructors as pedagogical tools. The study intends to include a population of deaf and hard-of-hearing students and aims to provide insight into the suitability of the puzzles for this group of students. The project aims to contribute to the growth and diversity of the national computing workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop an understanding of how pencil puzzles can provide an effective context for computer science education across populations. This project aims to investigate four research questions. (1) Do pencil-puzzle-based assignments promote measurable learning of computer science concepts and computational thinking across a diverse student population and at various types of institutions? (2) Are the engagement with and the grades on pencil-puzzle-based assignments independent of prior computing experience, gender, and other demographics? (3) Are pencil-puzzle-based assignments suitable for upper levels of collegiate computer science education and for K-12 students learning computational thinking? and 4) Are pencil puzzles valuable to a broad spectrum of educators, including undergraduate educators (including faculty and teaching assistants) and K-12 teachers? The PIs plan to collaborate with instructors at seven different undergraduate institutions (ranging from research intensive to small liberal arts institutions) as well as a middle school and a high school to develop assignments suited to each institution's student body and course format. The project intends to make the new assignments available through an existing online repository (https://www.cs.rit.edu/~pencilpuzzle/#/). Assessments of pencil puzzle effectiveness will take place at each institution and include interviews with instructors and teaching assistants, student surveys, and student grades.  The project intends to include extended training of instructors in the use of pencil puzzles to increase their impact on student learning and demonstrate the utility and adoptability of the approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

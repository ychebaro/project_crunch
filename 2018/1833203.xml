<AbstractNarration>An interactive scientific and educational workshop will be held at Masaya Volcano (Nicaragua) in February of 2019. The meeting will bring together graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and early career faculty to gain hands-on experience with collection, processing, and interpretation of ground- and satellite-based observations of volcanic processes, and will provide an immersive networking opportunity for students, early career faculty and international collaborators. The workshop will entail an initial (pre-workshop) deployment, ongoing field study during the workshop, lectures and presentations, and data analysis. A follow-up mini-workshop in the US will allow the workshop PIs to complete data analysis, integration, and publication. This workshop is the second in a planned series of innovative workshops involving targeted study of select open-vent volcanic systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Masaya Volcano is the ideal locale for this workshop owing to the current presence of a dynamic and easily accessible lava lake. The volcanic activity is amenable to a range of geophysical data collection, including seismic, infrasonic, geodetic, optical, thermal, and ground-based UV and microwave sensing. It also presents an ideal opportunity the integration of remote sensing observations from satellite platforms (e.g., geodetic, gas, optical and thermal), with ground-based observations. The scientific program will focus on data acquisition, processing, and analysis techniques through hands-on demonstration and focused discussion. Novel scientific insights are expected from integration of diverse data sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>The National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis (NIMBioS) will host its tenth annual "Undergraduate Research Conference (URC) at the Interface of Mathematics and Biology" from 27 - 28 October 2018, in Knoxville, Tennessee. Since 2009, the conference has showcased undergraduate research in mathematical biology, has provided students a chance to practice their scientific presentation skills in front of a supportive audience of peers, and has given students a venue to network with others having similar interests. In addition, two invited lectures by leaders in research at the interface of mathematics and biology provide students with insights into current research in this area. About one hundred participants will attend the conference, many from traditionally underrepresented groups in mathematics and biology. All student participants have the opportunity to present their choice of a research talk or poster. The event strengthens exchanges between the mathematical sciences and life science disciplines, as many of the projects are presented by student teams of math and life science majors. It is not uncommon to hear from life science students attending the conference that their eyes have been further opened to the usefulness of mathematics for making exciting progress on biological questions, and for mathematics students to be inspired by encountering new applications for their mathematical tools of which they were previously unaware.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NIMBioS URC's primary objective is to provide opportunities for undergraduates from across the country to share their research at the interface of biology and mathematics with peers and faculty mentors. Between fifty and seventy contributed student talks and posters are featured. Student abstracts will be gathered into a program book and published on the conference website. Students present their own work that uses mathematical, statistical and computational approaches to address challenging questions in molecular biology, biochemistry, epidemiology, immunology, ecology, and other areas. Their work comes from summer or academic year research experiences supported by a variety of agencies including NSF, the National Institutes of Health, the National Security Administration or through their home institutions, thus allowing for cross-pollination of ideas from different programs. As a side benefit, the research programs of the faculty mentors are enriched by the sharing of information about recent research and forming new connections. The conference's secondary goal is to provide students with information on careers and graduate school and opportunities to network. The conference will host a panel discussion on career opportunities, a graduate school showcase, and ample networking opportunities through shared meals, frequent breaks, and an organized networking activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

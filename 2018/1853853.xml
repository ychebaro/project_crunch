<AbstractNarration>Wind erosion and dust emissions from global drylands impact ecosystem health, agricultural production and food security, human health and climate. Despite extensive study of how wind erosion and dust emission occur, and how they affect Earth's atmosphere and human populations, little is known about where, when, and why the processes take place across different ecosystems, or how changes to Earth's ecosystems influence their rates at different locations over time. Understanding these interactions is important for land managers to identify where wind erosion and blowing dust may be a problem and act to sustainably manage agriculture and ecosystems over the long term. This research will examine how different types of ecosystem change occurring across North America due to human disturbances, drought, fire and invasive plant species impact rates of wind erosion and dust emission. The research will promote international collaboration among researchers in the United States and United Kingdom as part of a NSF/GEO-UK NERC project. It will produce new information that supports management of North American drylands and will generate educational materials for K-12 students and provide scientific training to underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will establish wind erosion dust emission responses to regional ecosystem changes across North America due to three disturbance regimes: 1) numerous discrete, small scale (&lt;10 ha), abrupt ecosystem changes associated with energy (oil and gas) development; 2) discrete, large scale (&gt;1000 ha), abrupt ecosystem change associated with fire and ecological feedbacks that promote invasive grasses and altered fire-wind erosion regimes; and 3) diffuse, large scale (&gt;1000 ha), pervasive ecosystem changes associated with sustained shrub invasion of desert grasslands. New aeolian (wind-driven) sediment transport models driven by remote-sensing and broad-scale standardized ecological datasets will be used to resolve the impacts of the regional ecosystem changes on wind erosion and dust emission. The models will be calibrated using data from US National Wind Erosion Research Network sites, then applied to explore patterns of dust emission across North America. National ecological datasets will be used to analyze the drivers and interpret dust emission responses to regional ecosystem changes across the disturbance regimes. The research will significantly improve our understanding of the coupling between the dust cycle and anthropogenic drivers of ecosystem change. This project is jointly funded by the Geomorphology and Land-use Dynamics Program, the Ecosystem Science Program, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

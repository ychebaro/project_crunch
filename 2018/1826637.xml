<AbstractNarration>The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the STEM workforce through increasing the number of underrepresented minority students successfully completing degree programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines.  The All Nations Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (ANLSAMP) has a long history of successfully implementing innovative student programs that has been instrumental to program success.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The mission of the ANLSAMP is to increase the number of American Indians and other underrepresented minorities receiving a baccalaureate degree in STEM. This is accomplished through direct participant support and collaborations with 35 geographically diverse partner institutions. ANLSAMP provides students support at critical junctures during their academic career. This includes financial support, conference travel assistance, and domestic and international research opportunities. In addition, ANLSAMP offers students an intercultural education component shown to positively impact retention. The Resilience through Intercultural Skill Enhancement (RISE) program teaches the skills needed to thrive in diverse cultural environments. RISE is the focus of a scientific research project to investigate the effectiveness and efficiencies of various program delivery methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>The broader impact of this NSF INCLUDES project address the culture and preparation of the current and future mechanical engineering workforce, as well as expand the breadth of stakeholders responsible for contributing to the preparation and development of future mechanical engineers from underrepresented groups. A project of this magnitude would contribute to the emerging field of research that bridges various stakeholders in engineering preparation and workforce development. Cross-disciplinary approaches will be highlighted and used to contribute to the emerging field of research that bridges various stakeholders in engineering preparation and workforce development. The outcomes of this convening have the potential to: 1) advance knowledge for all organizations working to address the gap in mechanical engineering preparation of women and workforce and 2) lay the foundation for exploring other non-male identified individual's role in mechanical engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project aims to bring together qualified experts in engineering diversity and inclusion, industry, professional societies, government, and academia(colleges of engineering and community colleges) to apply their collective knowledge to discuss the current academic and professional preparation and retention of women in mechanical engineering. This conference will align and leverage the various individual strategies of stakeholders working to address the gender gap and build a connectedness that would fuel cultural change. This conference aims to examine, challenge, and discuss engineering education practices and culture as key elements in increasing the number of women in mechanical engineering, thereby contributing more significantly to increasing the diversity and competitiveness of the overall engineering workforce. The overall goal of this conference is to engage current NSF INCLUDES awardees working on broadening participation in engineering as well as the broader academic, industry, and nonprofit engineering community, to provide a platform for the examination of demonstrated approaches, activities, and implementation strategies to increase the number of women graduating and working in the mechanical engineering field. Projected outcomes include expanded/strengthened networks, improved knowledge of baseline research and models to improve women's participation in ME, the creation of a national community of support for women in ME, and implementation of the recommendations from the research strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF INCLUDES Conference is co-funded by the Broadening Participation in Engineering (BPE) program. BPE is dedicated to supporting the development of a diverse and well-prepared engineering workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

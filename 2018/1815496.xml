<AbstractNarration>The need for concurrent programming is growing, especially after the multi-core revolution. This project aims to help concurrent programmers be more productive and produce software of higher quality. This will be of paramount importance for society's software infrastructure. The project will develop general techniques that are easily applicable to many mainstream programming languages such as C++, Java, and Scala. The project's novelties are a notion of specified orders along with a program logic and machine-checked proofs of well-known concurrent algorithms. The project's impacts are approaches to concurrent programming that allow programmers to write once, prove once, and run efficiently anywhere. The investigator will work with a PhD student on the project and will teach the results to students in an undergraduate course and a graduate course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For concurrent programs, programmers often face a mismatch between their assumptions about execution and the memory model of a specific architecture. For example, a programmer may need two instructions to execute in order for the program to be correct, yet most architectures execute out of order. This project will enable programmers to specify such assumptions, prove correctness, and run efficiently on a wide variety of architectures. Specified orders are easier to understand, reason with, and optimize than existing mechanisms such as barriers (assembly language), atomic orderings (C++), and volatiles (Java, Scala).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

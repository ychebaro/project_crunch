<AbstractNarration>The University of Rhode Island Graduate School of Oceanography will host the Ocean Observatories Initiative Facilities Board (OOIFB) Administrative Support Office (ASO). The OOIFB ASO will assist the OOIFB in engaging researchers and educators through webinars, workshops, and sessions at major oceanographic conferences so that science discoveries and OOI educational approaches can be shared broadly, optimizing the capabilities of the OOI facility. The Education and Outreach program includes seagoing experience for early career scientists, building an early career scientist network, creation of an OOIFB education committee and involvement of the URI Inner Space Center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) is providing new opportunities to the ocean community with access to a continuous stream of data from its cabled and un-cabled arrays located at critical coastal and global sites. The OOI program is a Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction (MREFC) project funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) that includes a network of interactive, globally distributed sensors with near real-time data access. The OOI data will enhance our capabilities to address critical issues such as ecosystem variability, ocean acidification, and carbon cycling. In 2017, NSF formed the OOI Facilities Board (OOIFB) to provide independent community-based input and guidance regarding the management and operation of the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI). With support from this award, the University of Rhode Island Graduate School of Oceanography will host the OOIFB Administrative Support Office (ASO). The OOIFB ASO will assist the OOIFB in engaging researchers and educators through webinars, workshops, and sessions at major oceanographic conferences so that science discoveries and OOI educational approaches can be shared broadly, optimizing the capabilities of the OOI facility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

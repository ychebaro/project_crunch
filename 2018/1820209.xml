<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR)&lt;br/&gt;project is to improve outcomes and decrease costs in the mental health space by engaging&lt;br/&gt;patients starting with their first therapy session through objective progress reporting and&lt;br/&gt;post-session motivation. Patients and clinicians alike will be able to track and assess treatment&lt;br/&gt;progress through self-reported and physiological measures. This innovation builds upon the&lt;br/&gt;strong academic, government, and industry partnerships that will advance research and&lt;br/&gt;innovation in the field of biotechnology. By demonstrating improved outcomes and decreased&lt;br/&gt;costs associated with the utilization of technology, this will pave the way for insurance&lt;br/&gt;reimbursement (using existing CPT codes) to accelerate market adoption. Additionally, as&lt;br/&gt;education of patients and the public improves regarding mental health and PTSD in particular,&lt;br/&gt;the negative stigma surrounding these conditions will decrease and more people in need will&lt;br/&gt;seek help rather than resorting to unhealthy behavior or even suicide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This STTR Phase I project proposes to represent an innovative approach that provides easy to&lt;br/&gt;interpret results tailored to mental health providers, patients, and other non-technical users.&lt;br/&gt;Current mental health treatment and assessment has lacked qualitative, scientifically-based&lt;br/&gt;measurement. The need for a scientific measurement is evident, as about 8 percent of all&lt;br/&gt;adults - 1 of 13 people in this country will develop PTSD during their lifetime. Currently, 60%&lt;br/&gt;of adults diagnosed with a mental illness don't receive mental health treatment; using proven&lt;br/&gt;science and physiologic measurements as the foundation for improving treatment and&lt;br/&gt;monitoring progress for PTSD can help to alleviate some of the stigma surrounding mental&lt;br/&gt;illnesses. This project aims to demonstrate how implementing a web-based platform can&lt;br/&gt;improve PTSD treatment by providing physiologically relevant feedback to the patient and by&lt;br/&gt;providing a tool for the clinician to tailor the therapy to the individual patient. Patients will have&lt;br/&gt;their subjective measures and physiological data visualized throughout treatment on a software&lt;br/&gt;platform, with progress being tracked through validated assessment scales. Patients will be&lt;br/&gt;compared to others in treatment as usual. Results should yield improved quality of life and&lt;br/&gt;decrease long term healthcare costs for those that use the platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

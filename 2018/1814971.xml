<AbstractNarration>This purpose of this work is to test the standard cosmological model that describes the origins and evolution of the universe. In this model the universe is dominated by as-yet unknown components: dark energy and dark matter, and its large cosmic structures have grown via gravity from initial features imprinted at the start of the universe. This model faces two current issues: the current expansion rate of the universe inferred from two different measurements is in disagreement, and the expected size of cosmic structures is also in some disagreement from different measurements. This work focuses on testing those issues by using new data to make an independent measurement of the expansion rate and the sizes of cosmic structures. The project will have an emphasis on the support and training of junior women in the field, as well as taking steps to recruit women into the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will use new high resolution, high sensitivity measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation to make an independent measurement of the expansion rate of the universe, and a refined estimate of the sizes of cosmic structures. The project uses the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, a six-meter NSF-supported telescope in Chile, currently observing the millimeter-wave sky. This work will involve computing key statistical properties of maps of the microwave background radiation to infer the expansion rate of the universe, and combining these data with measurements of the distortions of galaxies from the optical Hyper-Suprime Cam survey, to infer the size of cosmic structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

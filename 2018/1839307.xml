<AbstractNarration>Scientists in diverse domains from astronomy and atmospheric sciences, to earth sciences and genomics are generating massive datasets at an unprecedented scale. Rapidly evolving computational and data management technologies for harnessing value from these datasets are providing the foundation for a vibrant ecosystem by establishing robust collaborations and building communities of domain scientists, data scientists, and engineers.  These collaborations are central for transforming these datasets into information and knowledge. Barriers of both a technical and non-technical nature can hamper productivity for such transdisciplinary teams and collaborations, especially when highly productive teams with diverse expertise and computational backgrounds work on common problems. These barriers are often associated with frictions at the boundaries of computational technologies and human communications, especially when working at scale. Overcoming such challenges is critical for ensuring successful outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will bring together participants representing thought-leaders and practitioners in data-driven open science projects, TRIPODS+X project teams, and participants from the astronomy and earth sciences communities through two Innovation Labs. The first Lab will introduce participants to the national NSF-funded cyberinfrastructure and commercial cloud infrastructure, providing the opportunity to evaluate and learn from exemplary projects that have utilized these platforms for their collaborations, allowing participants to explore how their communities can extend these platforms for their data science projects in a reliable, scalable and reproducible manner. The second Innovation Lab will establish an early prototype TRIPODS Commons, a cohesive platform for showcasing, experimenting with, and sharing research products (code, data, methods), eventually becoming an avenue that provides visibility to the vibrancy and productivity of projects occurring at all NSF TRIPODS Institutes. Through these Innovation labs, the project will provide pragmatic approaches and pathways for establishing successful transdisciplinary collaborations that enable teams to work across domains and institutional boundaries, and at scales essential for addressing the research, education, and advanced cyberinfrastructure needs as outlined in NSF's 10 Big Ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

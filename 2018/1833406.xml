<AbstractNarration>This award is for the partial support of the International Conference on Electron, Ion and Photon Beam Technology and Nanofabrication (EIPBN) to be held May 29 to June 1, 2018, in Rio Grande, Puerto Rico. The conference includes presentations, free exchange of ideas, and extended discussions and interactions among international participants, academics, industry leaders and government stakeholders. This forum is instrumental in the generation and incubation of breakthrough and transformative ideas in many scientific areas including nanotechnology and nanomanufacturing. This award will partially support the participation of junior participants, including graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and early career faculty members. Students and faculty from Puerto Rico will be encouraged to attend the conference. NSF funds will support the attendance at the conference of a total of 36 students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EIPBN is a major international meeting and will provide a single forum for discussion of the latest developments in directed energy-enabled synthesis, fabrication, imaging, measurement and characterization of small-scale structures, multi-layered devices and multi-scale systems. Regular meetings of the key researchers, developers and users in this field are necessary for the exchange of ideas, information, and state-of-the-art technologies, to enable and accelerate advances and breakthroughs in nanopatterning and nanomanufacturing. This international conference is a key mechanism for linking basic science with engineering towards the development of useful nano-enabled products, which are significant to the US and world economies. This conference offers a forum for the open exchange of new and previously unpublished scientific research and ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is a patient-centric engagement process that offers the best chance for enabling a scalable approach towards achieving the triple aim of improving care quality and outcomes, controlling health care costs and utilization, and increasing patient satisfaction. Currently the national healthcare cost is estimated at  $3.2 trillion. Until patients could be engaged to take ownership of their health, advancement in pharmacological interventions through medications will not be able to achieve optimal care outcomes, and the healthcare cost and utilization will remain high. Engaging patients in self-management activities that are in alignment with the motivation indicators not only improves patient experience and satisfaction, but contributes to collecting big data for linking motivation to behavioral therapy --- resulting in an effect essential to improving population health and advancing personalized precision.     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is a patient-centric engagement process MISA (Measure-Integrate-Share-Act). While well-established behavior models such as the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skill (IMB) have been reported to show clinical efficacy, the novelty of this research is the application of Structure Equation Modeling to develop a quantitative behavior model. Quantitative behavior modeling is significant because it allows a rigorous assessment of the model in terms of goodness of fit and statistical power. Furthermore, such model provides the patented SIPPA analytic engine a basis to predict the software services that are in alignment with the motivation indicators of a patient users in order to effectively engage them in self-health management of chronic conditions, and to promote behavioral change for healthy lifestyle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

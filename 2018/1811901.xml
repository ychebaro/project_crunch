<AbstractNarration>Neutrinos are fascinating elementary particles and understanding their characteristics may explain why there is more matter than anti-matter in the universe.  Neutrinos have very small mass and zero electric charge so they could be their own anti-particle, and that is their key to unlocking the matter vs anti-matter content of the universe.  This award focuses on determining if neutrinos are their own anti-particles using the NEMO-3 and SuperNEMO experiments developed by the Neutrino Ettore Majorana Observatory (NEMO) collaboration.  A prototype of the SuperNEMO design will be commissioned soon, and this award will support the research of a graduate student who will earn his dissertation using the newly commissioned equipment.  The research will include background analysis, energy resolution improvements, and a search for neutrinoless double beta decay.  The student will develop highly technical skills that will allow him to contribute to STEM fields.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NEMO-3 experiment collected data by employing about 10 kg of thin isotopic foils surrounded by a wire drift chamber for 3D particle tracking in a 25 G magnetic field and scintillator blocks to measure the energy of electrons.  This unique technique provides several observables for each registered event, offering a powerful means to identify double beta decays and to reject background processes.  SuperNEMO will further exploit the NEMO-3 technique.  The goal of SuperNEMO is to use 100 kg of Se-82 or some other isotope to probe the half-life for neutrinoless double beta decay at the level of 1x10^(26) years in a 500kg*year exposure, corresponding to the effective neutrino mass in the 50 meV range.  The research supported by this award will include the commissioning of the first SuperNEMO module.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

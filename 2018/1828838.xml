<AbstractNarration>This objective of this award is to organize the inaugural Aspiring Principal Investigator (PI) meeting for Computer Systems Research (CSR). The workshop will assemble a group of aspiring CSR PIs with diverse backgrounds, fostering the growth of the CSR community.  Participants interested in computer systems research, but who have not received funding from the program, will have a better understanding of the CSR program and prepare them for developing competitive CSR proposals in the future.  A number of PIs will be selected from HBCU/MEI and under-represented groups.  The workshop is to be held at the National Science Foundation (NSF) Headquarters in Alexandria, VA on Friday, May 11, 2018.  The format will include presentations of information of CSR related solicitations, talks by recent CSR awardees, and a session to discuss the NSF panel review process, including discussion of traits of successful CSR proposals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

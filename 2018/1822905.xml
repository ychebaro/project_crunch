<AbstractNarration>University of Hawaii proposes to support technical services on R/V Kilo Moana (KM), a 185? general purpose research vessel operated as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet.  The proposal requests support for basic services and specialized services.  For basic services, they will provide two shipboard technicians on each cruise on R/V Kilo Moana to support seagoing research projects and to maintain, calibrate and provide for qualified users items from their pool of shared-use research instrumentation.  The Institution, before this year, also supported some operations on the R/V Ka`imikai O Kanaloa (KOK), which is not a UNOLS vessel, but does support some federally sponsored research, including some for NSF.  As specialized services, they evaluate the quality of data from acoustic current profilers installed on UNOLS vessels as well as continue to support a flee-wide ADCP standardization and quality control oversight program.  The budget included with this proposal is for the first year in a five-year continuing grant. The out-years are estimates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts        &lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) supports conferences that seek to increase the research capacity of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) faculty at HBCUs. Virginia Union University will host a one-day workshop to provide information on STEM funding opportunities to faculty and administrators from non-research intensive HBCUs and community colleges in the mid-Atlantic region. The workshop will include NSF program officers from various directorates to engage with faculty, administrators and sponsored program officers from institutions typically underrepresented in NSF funding to discuss funding opportunities and grant management strategies. The proposed date of the workshop is September 21, 2018 and 100-150 participants are expected to attend. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HBCUs are a group of approximately 100 institutions of higher education across 20 states and the District of Columbia that make a disproportionately positive contribution to the diversity of the STEM workforce. Despite the significance of the relationship between HBCUs and STEM, HBCUs and community colleges, as a group, are underrepresented in the federal funding streams intended to support STEM activities. This workshop will allow NSF program officers to engage with faculty and staff from institutions typically underrepresented in NSF funding, while generating discussions on how to improve the overall funding rates of these underrepresented institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

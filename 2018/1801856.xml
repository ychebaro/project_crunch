<AbstractNarration>The increasing scale and complexity of parallel systems present enormous challenges to parallel applications. One such challenge is the integration and balancing of execution time, power, and resilience for parallel applications. The MuMMI_R project seeks to advance the scientific understanding of the interdependence among power, execution time, and resilience for various application-system configurations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MuMMI_R research aims to develop effective techniques for quantifying the complicated tradeoffs among execution time, power, and resilience, and to provide a tuning mechanism for user-defined metrics. Toward this goal, the research focuses on three interrelated research thrusts: (1) experimental research to conduct extensive experiments of a suite of representative application under different resilience strategies on various parallel architectures, (2) application-level co-modeling to develop analytical models and colored Petri net based simulation for quantifying the correlations and tradeoffs between execution time, power, and resilience, and (3) model-based analysis to examine the tradeoffs among resilience, execution time, and power for different application-system configurations, and to tune application implementations for a user-defined target metric on current and future systems. The resulting framework, MuMMI_R, will provide valuable insights into application-system interactions and aid in the design of efficient parallel applications (with respect to execution time, power requirements, and resilience), runtime systems, and computer architectures. The broader impacts include training of undergraduate and graduate students and the participation in programs such as REUs, CREU, and DREU to increase the participation of students from underrepresented groups in the project.</AbstractNarration>

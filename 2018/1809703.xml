<AbstractNarration>This award will support student and postdoctoral attendance at a workshop on computational complexity theory, organized by the Clay Mathematics Institute, and by the Computer Science Department at the University of Oxford.  Many leading figures in computational complexity have already made a commitment to attend the workshop, which will be held July 23-26 at the University of Oxford.  For these student attendees, the meeting serves as a valuable educational experience, both for the technical content of the talks and for the opportunities for networking that it provides. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award will provide partial support to approximately seven students, partly defraying the cost of travel and lodging. Efforts will be made to support students from under-represented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

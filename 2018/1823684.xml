<AbstractNarration>Systematic modeling, analysis, and design of social, economical, and technological systems require confluence of ideas from diverse scientific disciplines, including control theory, optimization, economics and game theory. These systems often involve multiple decision-making agents interacting over a network and form a subset of so-called cyber-physical-human systems. Examples of such systems include smart grid, connected and autonomous vehicles, smart manufacturing, and mixed human-automata systems. Recent advances in technology have made these systems increasingly pervasive in a broad range of applications. Effective design of these systems requires interactions among experts from engineering, economics, and social sciences as well as industry. This forms the basis for organizing the 7th Midwest Workshop on Controls and Game Theory on April 28 - 29, 2018 in East Lansing, MI, where leading experts on controls, optimization, game theory, economics and computation from the Midwestern states are brought together to facilitate interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary research interactions and collaborations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the workshop is to facilitate and enhance research discussions and collaborations among experts in a broad range of disciplines, including biology, economics, and engineering. The workshop has a broader agenda than the previous editions and involves an increased participation from industry. The invited speakers are leading experts in the areas of controls, game theory, applied probability, computation, dynamical systems, economics, and optimization. The three sub-themes, (i) networked control systems, (ii) application of game theory and optimization to societal systems, and (iii) connected and autonomous vehicles, ensure that the broad agenda of the workshop is focused both on theory and application of cyber-physical-human systems. The workshop also includes a poster session in which students and postdocs present their current research. The feedback and mentoring on their research from the leading experts will tremendously benefit these young researchers. The invited speakers are selected to ensure a broad representation of research areas and such exposure will also benefit young researchers immensely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>Members of the superfamily Diplostomoidea are parasitic flatworms that infect humans and wildlife, and many species are of importance in aquaculture and wildlife health. Diplostomoids have complex life cycles, sequentially infecting a series of hosts depending on life stage. While commonly encountered, the life cycles of specific flat worms are poorly understood, and their evolutionary history is unclear. This is problematic for robust discrimination of species, and in turn impedes efforts to understand their ecology, protect biodiversity and control diseases. In this project, a data-rich genomic approach will be used to comprehensively analyze the evolutionary relationships in this superfamily, revise higher taxonomy, describe new species, and match adult and juvenile helminth stages. Relationships among parasite species will be compared to those of their hosts to determine co-evolutionary patters with hosts across life stages. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collections will take place mainly in the Americas, including regions and host taxa little studied to date, and vouchered samples will be studied morphologically and processed using Sanger and several rounds of next-generation sequencing. Whole-genome sequencing will be used to develop a probe set targeting &gt;1000 conserved genomic elements, which will then be selectively sequenced in the remaining samples from ongoing and past collections for the construction of robust phylogenies. The probe set will be applicable and of benefit for the study of other, non-diplostomoid trematodes. The project is based in Puerto Rico and will support local graduate studentships and a postdoctoral researcher. Undergraduate courses will be modified (peer-mentoring, active learning, research experience) to increase learning and retention among underrepresented minorities in STEM, and to yield data relevant to the research component of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by the Division of Environmental Biology (Systematics and Biodiversity Science Cluster) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

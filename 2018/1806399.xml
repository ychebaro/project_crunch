<AbstractNarration>This award will fund the participation of US-based junior researchers in the "TQFT and Categorification" conference to be held at the Institut d'Etudes Scientifiques de Cargese on April 15-20, 2018.  The subject of Topological Quantum Field Theory (TQFT) has provided a critical testing ground where ideas from theoretical physics inform rigorous mathematical frameworks that lay the foundation for a quantum theory of gravity.   TQFTs have been particularly well studied in 3-dimensions, bringing about unprecedented interaction between mathematics and theoretical physics. Since the world we live in is 4-dimensional (including time),  truly understand it requires an extension of the techniques of 3-dimensional TQFTs into 4-dimensions.  This enhancement of mathematical structures has come to be called "Categorification".    This conference will advance this ambitious program to understand 4-dimensional TQFTs, while proving important opportunities for the establishment of new collaborations and the scientific development of young scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The "TQFT and Categorification" conference  aims to bring together researchers from different horizons around the central question of lifting the techniques from the study of 3-dimensional TQFTs to 4-dimensions.  The conference will be organized around three central themes: Heegaard-Floer homologies and symplectic geometry,  Algebraic categorification (including Khovanov homology, categorified quantum groups, and categorification at roots of the unity),  and  TQFT (including connections to physics,  super homologies, and non-semisimple invariants). The organizers expect this conference to be a catalyst for establishing lasting collaborations and new avenues of research. More information about this conference can be found at https://tqft.sciencesconf.org/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

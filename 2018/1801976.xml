<AbstractNarration>The investigator will research various problems within the field of algebraic geometry and related fields.  Algebraic geometry is one the most ancient subjects in mathematics with its origins traced to the algebraic study of curves by Greek mathematicians more than 2400 years ago.  Algebraic geometry drastically transformed around 60 years ago with the seminal work of Grothendieck.  This transformation led to more rigorous and much broader foundations with immensely powerful techniques which were employed to resolve a number of long-lasting conjectures not only within algebraic geometry but also other mathematical fields such as number theory, topology and statistics.  Most recently, the last few decades have seen the reach of algebraic geometry expand even further with an astounding array of practical applications.  Algebraic geometry now provides the technical backbone to cryptosystems governing online transactions, to computer graphics used in movies, games and virtual reality, to the computational methods in the study of biological systems  and the effectiveness of drug treatments, and to many other fields including data science, machine learning and computer vision. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to study a wide collection of ideas encircling the concept of moduli spaces.  In algebraic geometry, there is a large disparity between geometric intuition and the technical tools needed to prove results, and this disparity is perhaps no greater than in the study of moduli spaces.  A fundamental yet highly technical tool used to study moduli spaces is the theory of algebraic stacks.  The investigator will further the development of the foundations of algebraic stacks by in particular developing an intrinsic method to construct projective moduli spaces parameterizing objects that may have positive dimensional automorphism groups. The investigator will pursue applications of these foundational results to study the birational geometry of moduli spaces such as the D-equivalence conjecture motivated by mirror symmetry.  Finally, the investigator will attempt to apply sophisticated algebro-geometric techniques to tackle questions in algebraic complexity theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

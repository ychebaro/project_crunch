<AbstractNarration>Capturing the dynamic structure of a biological machine performing its function remains the holy grail of biology. Conventional tools provide only structural "snapshots" of stable states along the reaction pathway. This project aims to develop methods that will capture a full movie of a macromolecule's structure as it works. The research tools developed will be applicable to a wide variety of biological systems, and will be disseminated by means of publications, tutorials, conference presentations and the like, to accelerate their adoption. The education component of the project will emphasize the use of single molecule biophysics and computational tools for dynamic structure determination. It will provide high school, undergraduate, graduate students and postdocs training in state-of-the-art single molecule biophysics research, and offer leadership experiences for graduate students and postdocs as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this project will study the structure of the transcription bubble in a simple bacterial transcription system during initiation as a test case for developing new technological concepts. The existence of certain intermediates in bacterial transcription suggests common features of the process exist across the different domains of life and reflects a conserved regulatory mechanism; thus, the findings will have broad utility. For the purpose of dynamic structure determination, the project will combine experimental and theoretical tools, including multi-spot single-molecule FRET measurements, fast single-molecule microfluidic mixing, molecular dynamics simulations and time-resolved single-photon detection to acquire data on- and perform molecular modeling of- the transcription bubble during initiation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

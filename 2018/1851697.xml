<AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to the Jackson Laboratory (JAX), located in Bar Harbor, ME, will support the training of 12 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2019-2021. Undergraduates will conduct original research in mammalian functional genomics with a faculty mentor at JAX. Student research will expand their basic understanding of how an organism's genome determines its development and biological function. To prepare for genomics research, students will have access to online modules prior to and during their fellowship, will complete workshops in computational methods and bioinformatics, and will attend seminars to prepare them for graduate education and a career in genomics. Students will increase their self-confidence and build their network within a learning community that is part of the long-standing JAX Summer Student Program, including a shared on-campus residential program. The REU Site recruits undergraduate students at all levels. The goal is to develop a diverse community of learners including individuals from groups underrepresented in science, such as racial and ethnic minorities, people with disabilities, and people with a significant socioeconomic or educational disadvantage, including first-generation college students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that a total of 12 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. Students trained in genomics will become more versatile, be able to work in teams with the potential for higher impact research. REU students at JAX will become better communicators and more aware of the ethical, legal, and social responsibilities of genomics scientists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A common web-based assessment tool used by all REU Site programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information about the JAX program is available by visiting https://www.jax.org/ssp, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Linda Hicke, linda.hicke@jax.org) or the Program Director (Michael McKernan, michael.mckernan@jax.org).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

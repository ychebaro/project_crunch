<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable mobile robots to coexist harmoniously with people in their homes and offices. The market for consumer and office robots is projected to grow 17% annually, seven times faster than the market for manufacturing robots, reaching $1.5B by 2019. An important step toward market growth is creating autonomous robots that are unobtrusive, intelligent, and highly agile. Accomplishing this requires robots to be small enough to stay out of the way and fast enough to elegantly avoid humans and environmental obstacles. Inappropriate noise levels and safety concerns make it unlikely that airborne vehicles will be prevalent in indoor environments, whereas wheeled mobile robots can achieve near-silent operation. Tiny, fast robots are unobtrusive enough to use as a low-cost surveillance tool in home or office security, and portable enough for covertly investigating hostile situations. People with severe disabilities could travel vicariously by combining a virtual reality headset with a telepresence robot.&lt;br/&gt;Fast maneuvering robots could be used as a compelling educational or entertainment platform for kids and adults.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will integrate the Phase I feasibility work on multi-surface aggressive maneuvering for small robots into a consumer-affordable hardware platform suitable for commercialization. In addition to developing a miniaturized robotic platform, this project will also address challenges outside the scope of Phase I related to home-scale autonomous navigation to locations of interest, which can be fixed (such as a room) or dynamic (such as the location of a pet). Such challenges&lt;br/&gt;include multi-room mapping, planning, path execution, and high-speed obstacle avoidance. This project will also develop fail-safe reactive techniques for navigation in situations where a model of the environment is either incorrect or altogether unavailable. Four key Phase II objectives will address these challenges: 1) multi-room surface-aware maneuvering with vision-based localization, 2) efficient maneuvering in the presence of obstacles and clutter, 3) map initialization for monitoring places of interest, and 4) development of the final hardware platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

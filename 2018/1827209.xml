<AbstractNarration>This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. Professor Liguo Song from Western Illinois University (WIU) and colleagues Jenq-Kuen Huang (WIU), Meshack Afitlhile (WIU), Audra Sostarecz from Monmouth College, and Caitlin Deskins from Quincy University have acquired a high-resolution quadrupole, time-of-flight, liquid chromatograph mass spectrometer (Q-TOF-LCMS). In general, mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and characterize small quantities of chemical species embedded in complex samples. In a typical experiment, the components flow into a mass spectrometer where they are ionized into ions and then the masses of the ions are measured. This highly sensitive technique allows the structure of molecules in complex mixtures to be studied. An instrument with a liquid chromatograph can separate mixtures of compounds before they reach the mass spectrometer. In the time-of-flight method, the mass-to-charge ratio of an ion is determined by the way of a time measurement in which ions are accelerated by an electric field of known strength. This acceleration results in an ion having the same kinetic energy as any other ion that has the same charge. The acquisition strengthens the research infrastructure at the University and regional area. The instrument broadens participation by involving diverse groups of students in research and research training using this modern analytical technique. It also provides training opportunities to many undergraduate students including those from underrepresented groups and will serve as a regional resource serving neighboring universities, agricultural associations and in institutions that need forensics analyses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It especially impacts trace level analysis of drugs of abuse in hair, investigation of the self-heating and spontaneous ignition process of vegetable oils, and investigations of the structure-function of antibacterial molecules with Langmuir monolayer films. The mass spectrometer aids researchers studying metabolic engineering of secondary alcohol dehydrogenase from the bacterium  nocardia cholesterolicum NRRL 5767 via CRISP/Cas9 genome editing and those investigating the slow pH-dependent equilibrium of protease inhibitor leupeptin. The instrument is also essential for the analyses of volatile compounds such as those in breads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

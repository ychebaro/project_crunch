<AbstractNarration>The development of global competencies in advanced degreed holders in STEM fields is critical to innovation, competitiveness, and economic development in the increasingly international marketplace of science and engineering.  This workshop brings together experts from different types of organizations (universities, non-profit entities, funding agencies, private sector) that participate, engage in, or have significant roles in STEM graduate education/training programs to formulate a series of recommendations on how best to structure programs that provide international experiences for graduate students.  The goal would be to identify the most efficient ways to support graduate students in their development of global competencies that will not increase time-to-degree or detract from their technical contributions.  The workshop also explores related topics such as how to provide international research experiences to students from under-represented groups and those who are economically disadvantaged. This event addresses concerns common to international research experiences for graduate students across all STEM disciplines.  Attendees/participants include representatives from the natural sciences, biological sciences, physical sciences, engineering, and social sciences; experts in educational psychology, program evaluation, and international relations add to the breadth of the conversation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goals of the workshop are to address the following topical research questions;&lt;br/&gt;-- What is the appropriate role of the student's faculty research advisor (research mentor) in identifying, defining, permitting, and evaluating the advisee's international research activity?&lt;br/&gt;-- What are the appropriate timing and duration for introductory, follow-on, and subsequent international research experiences during a STEM PhD student's education/training?  What about a STEM master's student?&lt;br/&gt;-- What are the appropriate entities/metrics for assessing the international research activity experiences, defining the appropriate assessment tools, collecting and archiving data, and conducting longitudinal studies on international research experiences?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Presenters/attendees are selected by the organizing committee to reflect as broad a view as possible, including those calling for major changes in how international research activities are structured and funded.  The outcomes of the workshop will be a publicly-accessible report with recommendations to the higher education, industry, non-profit, and governmental agency communities on how to improve global skills development in STEM advanced degree holders through effective international research activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

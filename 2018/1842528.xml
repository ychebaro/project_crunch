<AbstractNarration>The American Indian Science and Engineering Society (AISES) proposes a Convening on Computer Science (CS) Education for Native Students. Native American students and professionals are significantly underrepresented in CS and this is a critical time to convene stakeholders, develop an understanding of the barriers to CS education for Native students and Native-serving institutions, and identify resources and relationships necessary to truly effect change that will bring Native American students into the national CSforAll movement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AISES will recruit participants for the workshop with outreach within its network and partner networks, and through targeted outreach to key stakeholders. AISES will collaborate with Native education researchers and the AISES Education Committee and Tribal Nations Advisory Council to develop the convening's agenda. The primary objectives of the proposed convening are to: 1) use the collective knowledge of a diverse set of stakeholders to identify and understand the challenges and current best practices of providing CS education to Native students; 2) use this collective knowledge to develop strategies for increasing access to and engagement in CS among Native students; and 3) provide an overview of NSF opportunities and identify technical assistance needs to facilitate greater participation in NSF programs among tribes, Native-serving institutions, and Native education researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

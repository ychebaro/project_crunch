<AbstractNarration>There is strong cosmological and astrophysical evidence for cold dark matter as a major constituent of the universe. A compelling explanation is the existence of hitherto unknown Weakly-Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), and a world-wide experimental effort is on-going to test this hypothesis. The nature of Dark Matter, so far elusive, constitutes one of the most fundamental questions in science. Its discovery as a yet unknown particle would have profound implications in our understanding of the universe, and open new directions in particle physics and cosmology. With this award the DAMIC program will search for DM candidates beyond the heavy WIMP hypothesis by detecting nuclear and electronic recoils induced by light DM in charge coupled devices (CCDs). The DAMIC experiment currently in operation at SNOLAB has demonstrated unique sensitivity for low-mass DM particles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Immersive research experiences, engagement of the local community and innovative partnerships will bring DM science to formal and informal audiences. Research experiences developed in collaboration with programs focused on underrepresented groups - e.g., U. Chicago and Fisk-Vanderbilt Bridge - will enhance diversity at the graduate and undergraduate levels. The local community will be broadly engaged in Chicago by integrating high school URM students of the Space Explorers Program and of the STEM Science Inquiry and Research program in a stimulating research environment, by enhancing the RISE program for URM middle-school students and by communicating science to older adults via the Life-long Learning program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DAMIC at SNOLAB will stride to the forefront in the search for low-mass (&lt;5 times the proton mass) WIMPs by the end of 2018. DAMIC-M will capitalize on the DAMIC experience at SNOLAB and, at the same time, take a giant leap forward in sensitivity by radically innovating the detector technology. Its 36 Mpixel CCDs will be the most massive ever built, 20 g each. A novel concept for signal readout - based on the averaging of repetitive, uncorrelated measurements of the pixel charge - will result in the high-resolution detection of single electrons. By counting individual charges in a detector with extremely low leakage current - a combination unmatched by any other DM experiment - DAMIC-M will break new ground in the exploration of the hidden sector, which may be rewarded with serendipitous discovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

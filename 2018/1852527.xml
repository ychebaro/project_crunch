<AbstractNarration>This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site award to Mississippi State University, located in Starkville, MS, supports the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2020-2022. In this program, funded by the Division of Chemistry, participants pursue collaborative research projects at the interface of chemistry, engineering, and environmental science.  Participants learn about the interdependencies of water quality, fertilizer use for increased food production, and renewable energy using interdisciplinary approaches.  This research leads to the development of environmentally -engaged scientists and a better trained workforce.  Through seminars and workshops, this program also promotes entrepreneurial thinking and explores pathways to starting small businesses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants learn about the areas of energy security, water quality, food security and related issues. The research project areas include the conversion of biomass and energy crops into biofuels; the utilization of biochar (a biofuel production byproduct) for the purification of water; and the enhancement of food security through biochar soil amendment. Components of these projects include growing biomass, converting it into biofuels, and using the by-products to clean water and improve soil quality. These projects expose participants to research instrumentation, which encourages excitement for science and teaches participants practical skills that can translate to careers in the chemical sciences or graduate school. Alongside research, seminars and workshops shape an environmentally conscious and entrepreneurially-minded cohort, building a chemical sciences workforce ready to tackle big societal problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

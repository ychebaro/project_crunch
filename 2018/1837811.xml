<AbstractNarration>Aerosols strongly affect the thermodynamics of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) and the development of convective clouds from shallow boundary-layer clouds to deep convective clouds via aerosol-PBL interactions (API), aerosol-radiation interactions (ARI), and aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI). While the individual effects have been known, little has been done to account for their joint effects during the complete course of a convective process. Fully understanding and accounting for these joint effects is key for both climate and weather applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The following research will be carried out in this project:&lt;br/&gt;- Validation and application of novel research products;&lt;br/&gt;- Quantification of aerosol-induced changes in radiative heating and latent heat release associated with cloud condensation and freezing;&lt;br/&gt;- Gaining deeper insights into the effects of API, ARI, and ACI from the perspective of their joint influences;&lt;br/&gt;- Enhanced capability in simulating the various complex processes of boundary-layer and convective-cloud processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;Weather and climate models have systematic biases in rainfall simulations both in magnitude and timing associated with convective clouds: often overestimation and underestimation of light and heavy rainfall, respectively.  While the individual impacts of aerosols on the development of PBL, shallow boundary-layer clouds, and deep convective clouds have been tackled, a systematic study here is likely to lessen, if not solve, the problem. The study is also helpful in understanding and forecasting air pollution by accounting for the feedback between aerosols and the PBL, and severe weather events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

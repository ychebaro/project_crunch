<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) is central to the study of micrometer- and nanometer-sized features across a wide range of materials and objects. Access to TEM instruments is critical for conducting modern materials science research and for pushing the limits of understanding in other fields as diverse as biology and archeology. Specific projects that this instrument supports include microelectronics, self-healing materials, alternative energy sources, and semiconductor physics. Acquisition of this new TEM finalizes the creation of a regional electron microscope facility, available for use by educational and research institutions in the area and by regional companies and industries such as oil and gas, aerospace and advanced manufacturing. A new course focused on the theoretical and practical aspects of electron microscopy provides critical education and training to students. Outreach activities involve primary, secondary and four-year college students across the State of Oklahoma through a web-based tele-microscopy program. This student population includes many from traditionally under-represented groups in science and technology disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation award is for acquisition of a 120 kV transmission electron microscope with digital imaging, a high-resolution objective lens, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and scanning transmission electron microscopy (S/TEM) at The University of Tulsa. This TEM system enables research projects such as studying how nano-batteries can increase their capacities, self-sensing mechanisms of composite materials, bioengineering of microalgae for enhanced biofuel production, prehistoric evidence for the invention of cooking, molecular assembly of amino acids for sensing and medical treatments, properties of nanocrystals formed under electrochemical bias, and polarization coupling phenomena in ferroelectric heterostructures. The TEM also creates the potential for unique and potentially transformative research on the preservation and analysis of cultural heritage artifacts. The goal of this TEM acquisition is to integrate the new instrument into the Micro and Nano Fabrication and Characterization Laboratory (Nano Lab) at The University of Tulsa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

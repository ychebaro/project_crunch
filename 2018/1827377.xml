<AbstractNarration>In recent years there has been increasing scrutiny on diversity in the computer and information technology industry. Data on demographics portray an industry that lacks diversity. Even when engineers from underrepresented groups are hired by these companies, they tend to leave. Among people of color 40% of the men and 36% of the women leave due to unfair treatment. The economic cost of this issue is enormous. The cost to replace these workers is over $16 billion annually. Lack of diversity also results in lost productivity and innovation. Improving the diversity of the technology industry workforce requires a welcoming and inclusive workplace. In this project we are seeking to understand the experiences of Black engineers. The narratives developed from interviews with these workers are being used to illustrate the unique problems faced by Black engineers. Through conversations with industry leaders we are identifying approaches to make the workplace more welcoming to all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study involves interviews with 40 engineers in the technology industry. The goal of these interviews is to understand workplace climate. Interviews focus on the experiences they have had with their co-workers, supervisors, and customers. The data are being analyzed using narrative analysis, through the lens of three frameworks: Faulkner's in/authenticity, Helms and Piper's pairing of racial identity theory and vocational psychology, and Kendi's history of racist ideas. The result is individual narrative case studies for each person. Cross-case comparison identifies commonalities and differences in workplace culture, impact of social identity, and perceptions of inclusivity. Through conference sessions, we are creating a community of researchers focused on diversity and inclusion in the engineering workplace. Additionally, we are sharing findings and implications directly with industry leaders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

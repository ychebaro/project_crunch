<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the conference "Interacting Particle Systems, Statistical Mechanics, and Related Topics" held at the University of California, Los Angeles, March 7-9, 2019. The conference brings together a diverse group of researchers in the areas of interacting particle systems and its applications in various related areas. The conference aims to advance research through communication of recent results to a wide audience that includes graduate students and recent doctoral degree recipients, as well as members of groups that are not well represented in the mathematical sciences. Priority for financial support is given to graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, women, and minorities, as well as to junior faculty who may not otherwise be able to attend. The conference seeks to facilitate interaction between the young researchers and the leading figures of the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference aims to bring together the communities of mathematicians working on the subjects of interacting particle systems and related topics in statistical mechanics with those in the areas of random graphs, random matrices, mathematical biology, stochastic partial differential equations, and random growth models, where techniques and results from the theory of interacting particle systems have found recent application. The conference will focus on some of the most important current questions in these fields and aims to foster discussions, new collaborations, and new directions of research.  In addition to leading researchers, the conference will include early-career researchers who work in these subject areas.  More information is available at the conference web site https://sites.google.com/view/ips2019 .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>Across the nation, manufacturing and distribution industries have growing needs for skilled technicians, including those with skills in advanced manufacturing and in transportation, distribution, and logistics (TDL). Orangeburg-Calhoun Technical College aims to address this need in its region by enhancing the preparation of students for TDL technician careers. Courses in advanced manufacturing and TDL at the college will be expanded to include a simulation laboratory component. The simulations will include a set of modular real-world scenarios that combine the business, logistics, production, and security sides of automated manufacturing. Teams of students will use these problem-based simulations to interactively troubleshoot, find solutions, and review the process. This approach will use emerging simulation technologies to better prepare students for the changing workplace. The project will also introduce high school students to the types of job opportunities in these fields and education requirements for these positions. In addition, high school students will be able to enroll and obtain dual credit for the TDL-related courses. Recruitment efforts will focus on increasing the number of women and underrepresented minorities in the manufacturing workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to prepare TDL technicians by exposing students to emerging simulation technologies in a multi-disciplinary work environment. Twelve interdisciplinary, real-world simulations will be developed in the areas of advanced manufacturing and TDL, with input from local industry partners. These simulations will be used to enhance existing courses at the institution. A simulation laboratory will be established using a small production line that is fully networked and equipped with several sensors. In conjunction with this system, a resource planning system will allow students to monitor production and control the business processes associated with the manufacturing and order fulfillment process. This integration is designed to provide students with the technical skills and disciplinary knowledge, as well as an understanding of the business side of manufacturing. A Middle College Pathway in TDL will be added so that high school students can obtain transferable credit for completing these courses. Workshops for postsecondary students and teachers will be conducted to promote awareness of career options and industry needs in advanced manufacturing and TDL technology areas. Outreach activities will include a focus on increasing participation of women and underrepresented minorities in these fields. The college location enables it to engage rural student populations in its advanced manufacturing training and outreach. The project aims to increase the number of skilled technicians and to strengthen the regional workforce by connecting supply chain issues, production applications, and network security in a coordinated program that emphasizes real-world simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

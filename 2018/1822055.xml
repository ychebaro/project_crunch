<AbstractNarration>The Fiber-Wireless Integration and Networking (FiWIN) Center for Heterogeneous Mobile Data Communications is an NSF Industry &amp; University Cooperative Research Program (I/UCRC) center led by Georgia Institute of Technology (GIT). Based on recognized research leadership and accumulated expertise in integrated fiber-wireless access technologies, FiWIN is favorably positioned to explore emerging access network architectures, functional designs of network elements, and optimizing system interfaces and operations for next generation mobile communication systems. FiWIN has successfully completed two years in operation, while this project is to establish a new addition of Auburn University (AU) as a Member Site. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The addition of AU broadens both technical expertise and, inevitably, new outcomes that can only be attributed to the "synergy" between GIT and AU. The FiWIN Center will continue to grow in visionary leadership, dedicated and well-rounded students, and the expanded interdisciplinary expertise. AU will contribute supplementary expertise focusing on: i) Radio Frequency Integrated Circuit (RFIC) design and future generation wireless systems, ii) innovative wireless applications such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), and iii) the AU Radio-frequency identification (RFID) Laboratory will contribute to Internet of Things (IoT) research with applications to storage, retail, and supply chain management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is part of a broad and ambitious collaborative effort between academia and industry to develop novel techniques to harvest the potential of heterogeneous mobile data communications enabled by the fifth generation wireless. It also strives to broaden participation from underrepresented groups. Graduate students will gain first-hand experience with industrial research projects. The outcomes from this project will be introduced into AU courses and an incoming textbook, and in particular, will enhance the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) accredited Bachelor of Wireless Engineering (BWE) curriculum at Auburn University. Various venues will be explored for industrial collaborations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A reference library will be maintained and be accessible to center members. It will contain experimental data and research products, in addition to Center documents such as NSF Annual Reports, Level of Interest and Feedback Evaluation (LIFE) Form Reports, Center Publications, Industrial Advisory Board (IAB) Presentations and Posters, Membership Agreement document, By-Laws document, and Center Action Items. An interactive web-based server will be used for sharing scientific data produced from the project with the IAB and the public. A single Center-wide repository will be maintained for the center, at http://fiwin.org, which will be maintained throughout the project period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>Heat waves are responsible for more deaths each year than all other natural disasters &lt;br/&gt;combined. In urban areas, extreme heat events are intensified by the Urban Heat Island effect, &lt;br/&gt;which results in even more extreme microclimates due to the physical layouts of cities, the use &lt;br/&gt;of certain building materials, and a reduction in natural landscapes. In this project, the &lt;br/&gt;investigator will identify landscape design recommendations to mitigate extreme heat hazards &lt;br/&gt;in urban microclimates. Body-worn and ambient sensors will be used to understand urban heat &lt;br/&gt;wave patterns and the influences that heat and humidity have on physiological functions such &lt;br/&gt;as the core body temperature of individuals utilizing outdoor urban areas.  A wearable and &lt;br/&gt;ambient sensor network will be extended and field-tested in Bloomington, Indiana. Geographic &lt;br/&gt;information systems will be used to classify urban areas within Bloomington &lt;br/&gt;into microclimates in order to ascertain exposure levels of heat and humidity hazards to &lt;br/&gt;residents. A real-time monitoring system for microclimates during heat extremes will be &lt;br/&gt;developed using participatory design with stakeholders such as city planners, public health &lt;br/&gt;officials, green infrastructure experts, and citizens. Results will include a new understanding of &lt;br/&gt;the effects of extreme heat events on human health and wellbeing and will provide methods to &lt;br/&gt;mitigate heat hazards through more effective use of information technology and urban green &lt;br/&gt;infrastructure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Urban heat extremes result in the highest number of fatalities across all types of natural &lt;br/&gt;disasters each year. The design of cities and urban areas contributes to the intensity of heat &lt;br/&gt;events through the Urban Heat Island effect. The investigator aims to use wearable sensors and &lt;br/&gt;embedded environmental sensors to better understand effects of extreme heat microclimates &lt;br/&gt;on human health. The method includes an extension of an existing person-environment sensor &lt;br/&gt;network to collect human physiological data and ambient temperature variances in &lt;br/&gt;microclimates. Current data and software tools will be used to explore, classify and integrate data to determine &lt;br/&gt;relationships between microclimate heat events throughout the city, interactions with humidity &lt;br/&gt;and wind speed variations, and human physiological responses, such as core body temperature. &lt;br/&gt;Through participatory design, prototype visualizations of real-time climactic changes in &lt;br/&gt;microclimates will be developed. This research will contribute to collaborative efforts among &lt;br/&gt;stakeholders to minimize risks to human health and design green infrastructure to mitigate the &lt;br/&gt;harmful effects of extreme heat events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

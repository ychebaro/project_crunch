<AbstractNarration>This conference award provides partial travel support for US participants to attend the "Workshop on Ramsey Theory and Computability Theory", to be held in Rome, Italy, in July 9-13, 2018.   The workshop seeks to capitalize on a string of recent results in reverse mathematics, more specifically, recent advances at the intersection of computability theory and combinatorics. A mixture of US based speakers and students will be supported.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will focus on the computability-theoretic and proof-theoretic strength of combinatorial principles such as Ramsey's Theorem for pairs and Hindman's Theorem.  More information on the workshop can be found at https://www3.nd.edu/~cholak/Colosseum.html&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

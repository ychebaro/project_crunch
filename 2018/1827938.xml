<AbstractNarration>This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. Professor Gustavo Moura-Letts from Rowan University and colleagues Subash Jonnalagadda, Joseph Stanzione and Lark Perez have acquired a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a smart ambient temperature probe. This spectrometer allows research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as allow study of biologically relevant species. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The instrument positively impacts several institutions in the greater South Jersey area and allows participation of many STEM students. A plan to make the current spectrometer available to institutions such as Cooper Medical School, Rowan School of Osteopathic Medicine, Rowan University at Camden, Rowan College at Gloucester County and Rowan College at Burlington County is going to be beneficial.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award of the NMR spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It especially aids investigations on reaction development and mechanisms for metallooxazirine mediated aziridination of pi systems and the syntheses of pharmacologically relevant molecular scaffolds. The instrument is also used in developing and characterizing small-molecule inhibitors of sRNA-Hfg chaperone protein binding and in generating a library of monomers, polymers, composites coatings and adhesives derived from renewable resources. In addition, it aids the development and characterization of reverse micelles, the studies of signaling pathways that mediate the S. cerevisae response to oxygen levels. The spectrometer benefits studies of dynamics of the dissociated proton in acidic ionic liquids, and measurements in studies of diffusion of ionic liquid solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>This renewal Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of Maine (UMaine) focuses on sensor science and engineering research which is of high interest to the consumer, national defense, and homeland security, and reflects one of the top research strengths at UMaine. UMaine's sensor science and engineering research ranges from basic theoretical studies to the design, fabrication, and testing of prototype sensors for chemical and biological agents related to environmental contamination and terrorism; biomarkers for cancer detection, diagnosing nerve damage; high temperature sensors for monitoring and improving the efficiency of jet engines and turbines for power generation (coal or natural gas); and optical sensors for environmental monitoring. Other areas of research relate to using artificial intelligence to combine and analyze large data sets obtained from networked sensors, and exploring climate change through supercomputer visualizations. The program will provide state-of-the art, interdisciplinary research and problem solving opportunities for a diverse cohort of REU participants. Undergraduates will utilize their new knowledge to solve real-life research problems that impact society. Society will benefit as undergraduates, as a result of their research experiences, choose to continue in graduate school to excel in technologically and scientifically challenging careers that advance such areas as homeland security, food safety, transportation, communications, and medicine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU program will offer a 10-week intensive summer research experience, for a total of 30 students, over a three year period. The program will include: 1) individual research projects with faculty research mentors utilizing specialized sensor science and engineering research facilities, 2) ethics training, 3) student meetings, 4) seminars, 5) field trips, 6) student presentations, and 7) career guidance, networking opportunities, and mentorship. A special effort will be made to recruit women and minorities and provide research experiences for students at non-PhD granting institutions. The REU participants will also interact with middle and high school teachers who were past REU and GK-12 participants to share their research experiences with middle and high school students, and provide a further role model for these students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>This proposal is for support of a travel to the 2018 International Green and Sustainable Computing Conference (IGSC).  IGSC has established itself as the premier conference in this area. Green computing is a newly evolving research area that is establishing itself as an interdisciplinary research area spanning across the fields of computer science and engineering, electrical engineering and other engineering disciplines. Green computing or sustainable computing is the study and practice of using computing resources efficiently, which in turn can impact a spectrum of economic, ecological, and social objectives. Such practices include the implementation of energy-efficient central processing units and peripherals as well as reduced resource consumption. In addition, IGSC covers applications and systems that use computing and information systems to accomplish sustainability in power grid, environment, climate, agriculture, and many other social and economic applications.  The conference offers researchers, industry participants, and students the forum for a growing awareness of the study and practice of using computing resources efficiently, which in turn can impact a spectrum of economic, ecological, and social objectives. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The grant allows students interested in green or sustainable architecture, networks, circuit design, software, and applications, as well as students interested in use of computing for sustainability in other areas, to find useful information on the topics of their choice. It also provides an excellent opportunity for many students nationwide to get familiar with and engage in a new research area of national importance. Students not having a paper in IGSC or otherwise without the resources that allow the opportunity to attend IGSC will be eligible for these travel grants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>At the most basic level Black Holes are  nothing  but  special, explicit,  solutions  of the  Einstein equations of General Relativity.  To have  physical reality  they have to possess  properties  which  make them detectable to observations. Chief among them is stability to perturbations. This translates to a very difficult, deep and beautiful mathematical conjecture which is the main  focus of the proposed   research.  The goal is to show that any  small perturbation, at a given time, of a given black hole solution remains small for all later  times. Thus all the important features of a unperturbed black hole are preserved by the perturbations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To solve the problem of stability of black holes one has to overcome a large range of difficult issues. The high non-linearity of the Einstein  equations makes it hard to separate them; they are all interconnected.  At the heart of all these difficulties is the issue of gauge. That means, roughly,  that one cannot solve the stability problem without finding a specific coordinate system  in which  one can  establish decay of the perturbations, i.e. to show that the perturbations converge to zero for large times. In collaboration with J. Szeftel in France the PI had proposed a new method to construct these coordinates  based on the full covariance properties of the  Einstein equations. The main methodology of the PI is to combine this new method, called Generally Covariant Modulation theory, with the the so called vector-field method.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

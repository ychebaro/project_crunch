<AbstractNarration>Computers with many tens to hundreds of ?cores? are on their way, but programming languages and tools&lt;br/&gt;that exploit them well have lagged. At the same time, there are emerging programming languages intended&lt;br/&gt;for writing programs to run on these computers. These languages, such as X10 and Fortress, add support for&lt;br/&gt;new concepts that make it easier to write many-core programs, but there does not yet exist good compiler and&lt;br/&gt;run-time support for these languages. Systems that run Java, namely Java virtual machines such as those that&lt;br/&gt;run on virtually every laptop, desktop, and server today, supply much of what the new languages need, but&lt;br/&gt;fall short in some important ways. In particular they do not provide for saying in which part of memory to&lt;br/&gt;place particular objects, on which core to run which computations, easy ways to get all cores busy working&lt;br/&gt;on different parts of a big piece of data, or for synchronizing and getting right all the data manipulations&lt;br/&gt;happening at the same time. This project is extending an existing research Java virtual machine (Jikes&lt;br/&gt;RVM) with support for many ways of doing the things that the new languages need in order to run well&lt;br/&gt;on many-core computers. The primary goal is to devise extensions to standard Java virtual machines for&lt;br/&gt;this new world, and to make it possible for many others to experiment with different ways of implementing&lt;br/&gt;these extensions, thus leveraging the creativity of the whole community of language and virtual machine&lt;br/&gt;researchers. Secondary goals include offering reasonably good initial implementations of virtual machine&lt;br/&gt;extensions as a starting point for future research and development, and proposing specific extensions to the&lt;br/&gt;Java virtual machine specification standard.</AbstractNarration>

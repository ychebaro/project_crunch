<AbstractNarration>With the explosive growth of Big Data and Internet of Things, and the ever-growing demand for high-performance computing, mobility, security, and high-fidelity experiences, there is an increasing need for high-bandwidth and low-loss interconnect technologies that enable efficient data transfer across the chip. The optical fiber and its significant capacity for high-bandwidth data transfer are well-known in the telecommunications industry, and widely exploited in their long-distance network of interconnects. Scaling down optical interconnects to fit in nano-scale silicon chips would clearly be advantageous for achieving high-bandwidth data transfer on-chip -- however, a major hurdle is the dearth of accurate and efficient computable stochastic electromagnetic models for simulation of optical interconnect structures comprised of multiple tightly-coupled nano-scale silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wave-guides that carry information signals (i.e., TeraHertz electromagnetic waves) across on-chip transmitters and receivers. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop algorithms for a software tool to perform the design, analysis, and optimization of 3-dimensional (3-D) nano-scale optical interconnects based on SOI wave-guides exhibiting random surface roughness. The overall educational components of this project are to leverage the developed models and software to: (1) develop new graduate courses, (2) develop interactive learning objects and lab-based activities for undergraduate courses, and (3) stimulate undergraduate students' interest in science, and recruit and mentor diverse groups of students including women and minority groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project team will develop the Optical Interconnect Designer Tool (OIDT) software, of which the input is comprised of: (1) the specified 3-D geometry representing the physical description of the multi-port optical interconnect system, (2) the random distribution for surface roughness of SOI wave-guide, and (3) the wave-guide material's electrical properties. The OIDT will autonomously synthesize two types of electrical models: (1) network scattering parameters for design optimization of the interconnect, in the frequency-domain, and (2) stable, passive, and causal SPICE equivalent circuit models for timing analysis and signal/power integrity analysis of the passive interconnect, integrated with active non-linear drivers and components, in the time-domain. The proposed Python-based software package may be used stand-alone, or integrated into existing computer aided design (CAD) tools and design-flows to facilitate design automation, and research and development of advanced microelectronics for a variety of applications including computing, communications, energy, security, sensing, health, etc. The numerical program will be hosted on GitHub as an open-source project, to facilitate and promote (inter)national optical device research. The education component expands public's scientific literacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>Modern scientific and big-data computing systems must balance multiple system attributes such as power, &lt;br/&gt;performance, and reliability to meet application science demands. These systems and their designers are, however,&lt;br/&gt;constrained by the lack of clear and well-defined methods to guide system design and tuning. This reduces the &lt;br/&gt;overall effectiveness of modern strategic computing systems. This project is developing new&lt;br/&gt;techniques for quantitatively characterizing and optimizing system tradeoffs in a wide range of&lt;br/&gt;modern strategic computing systems. The short term goal of this project is to develop models, analyses,&lt;br/&gt;and optimizations that will enable system software, applications, and system architects to make effective &lt;br/&gt;end-to-end performance tradeoffs. The desired long-term impact of this research is to increase the&lt;br/&gt;overall efficiency and effectiveness of current and emerging strategic computing systems. The techniques&lt;br/&gt;developed as part of this project will also be integrated with large-scale computing educational programs&lt;br/&gt;at the University of New Mexico and across the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is grounded in stochastic inter-collective-interval model for characterizing &lt;br/&gt;the performance of application/system-software configurations. To this end, the project is &lt;br/&gt;investigating techniques for estimating how different system software and applications mechanisms change &lt;br/&gt;application model parameters, providing a general means for understanding application/system software &lt;br/&gt;performance tradeoffs. In addition, the project is examining optimization techniques that leverage &lt;br/&gt;these models to improve resource allocation decisions in system schedulers and runtime systems. &lt;br/&gt;These techniques are being evaluated based on their ability to improve the overall performance of modern &lt;br/&gt;strategic computing systems in areas such as scheduling, power management, and data locality. The techniques&lt;br/&gt;developed as part of this project will also be integrated with large-scale computing educational programs&lt;br/&gt;at the University of New Mexico and across the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>This award provides partial support for an NSF and German Research Foundation workshop to foster collaborative research between the United States and Germany. Both the United States and Germany have vibrant manufacturing sectors, pervasive technology proliferation, and high wages. Both countries rank among the world leaders for technological sophistication, high technology product development and advanced manufacturing activity. Both countries have strong support for scientific and engineering research, and there are significant overlap and synergies between the funded research portfolios. While there are potential areas for collaboration, there are few venues where research topics that are mutually beneficial can be identified. Results of this workshop can also be useful to fostering collaborations between the two countries in other fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will be held on the east coast of the United States in June 2019. About 15-20 advanced manufacturing researchers from each country will participate in the workshop. The objectives of the workshop are to: 1) Revise research needs in advanced manufacturing as identified at the NSF/DFG Workshop held in February 2016. 2) Revise needs, gaps, and challenges facing advanced manufacturing. 3) Identify best practices of collaboration, and logistical challenges as observed by researchers in both countries engaged in U.S.- German collaborative projects. 4) Formulate recommendations for expanding and formalizing future joint research initiatives. 5) Provide a forum for researchers from the US and Germany to network and develop future collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

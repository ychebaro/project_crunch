<AbstractNarration>As data centers scale up, there is an increasing need for fast data replication to distribute computational load across servers.   This is especially true of distributed machine learning algorithms, where a 'master computer' must distribute computational updates (i.e., do a multicast) to 100's or even 1000's of other servers. For example, for text mining, each iteration of a computation can easily result in more than a 1 Gigabyte of data being distributed, with the total exceeding 1 Terabyte. Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art solutions for transporting these massive data sets in the data center rely on application-layer overlays where the data is transmitted sub-optimally as a large number of repetitive flows. This project seeks to realize a fundamental breakthrough in data center multicast performance by leveraging optical transmission to perform the multicast function by simultaneously connecting a source machine rack to multiple receiver machine racks with a reconfigurable optical device. The results of this work will impact data analytics, which increasingly drives the US economy, through much more efficient operation of datacenters.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops a scalable architecture leveraging distributed small port-count optical cross connect switches and optical splitters to realize a data center network that efficiently supports both unicast and multicast traffic. To fully achieve the potential of this architecture, this project designs, analyzes and evaluates: (1) Scalable, high performance network connectivity for an optical splitter network, addressing difficulties resulting from heterogeneous packet switch port-counts, link speeds and splitter configurations; (2) Different routing algorithms and their performance trade-offs for different network connectivity and workload, addressing challenges such as failure recovery; (3) Different algorithms for multicast demand placement and optical multicast network resource scheduling that aim to optimize application level performance; (4) Different approaches to exploit the flexibility of the distributed small port-count optical circuit switches for adapting to dynamic shifts between unicast and multicast traffic hot-spots; (5) A variety of real big data applications operating over this new architecture, addressing the system design and implementation challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

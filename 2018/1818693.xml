<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. Though this one-year planning project, Lincoln University will develop a minor in bioinformatics to advance knowledge in the field of bioinformatics, while training minority and underrepresented students in this growing field. This program of study would intersect chemistry/physics with biology, mathematics and computer science. Training students in interdisciplinary sciences such as bioinformatics has become more desirable, particularly with the noted underrepresentation of minorities and women in the field. Considering very few HBCUs offer undergraduate program in bioinformatics, Lincoln University is well position to contribute to diversifying the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bioinformatics combines computer science, mathematics, and information technology to facilitate the collecting, organizing, and processing of large volumes of biological and chemical data. Bioinformatics concepts will be initially employed in existing biology and mathematics courses to further gauge student interest for the development of upper level, stand-alone courses. The successful implementation of a minor would serve as the premise to develop a major in bioinformatics at Lincoln University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

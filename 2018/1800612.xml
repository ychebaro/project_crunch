<AbstractNarration>The manufacturing workforce is one of the largest sectors in the nation's workforce. In the state of Ohio, employment in industries such as food manufacturing and computer and electronic product manufacturing are expected to continue to grow. In this project, Columbus State Community College will collaborate with Lorain County Community College, other educational institutions, as well as state and industry partners to address this growing need. The project will build a statewide network to advance experiential work-based learning programs and recruitment for the advanced manufacturing field. The work-based learning model will focus on students applying their skills in a specific occupation. The network will promote best practices for this model and support faculty in using the principles of work-based learning at community colleges. The project will enhance the preparation of students, increase the number of skilled technicians, and help strengthen the regional workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will aim to increase the supply of qualified advanced manufacturing technicians by creating new opportunities for work-based learning and outreach to students through a collaborative, structured statewide network. Three objectives will guide the work of the project. First, the project team will create a work-based learning online platform to collect and share best practices and resources, and provide promotional tools for companies, educators, and students. Second, the team will form a statewide network for community colleges and an industry leadership team for developing public-private partnerships. Third, the principal investigators will develop an outreach and recruitment strategy that community colleges can utilize to increase the number of students entering advanced manufacturing career pathways. The online platform will allow educators to form a community of practice for work-based learning to determine the best-practice models that align with their institutions and obtain advice from peers on adapting and launching work-based programs. Students will be able to use the platform to explore these programs and learn how to prepare for these experiences. Companies will also be able to participate on the platform to learn about benefits of various work-based learning models, how to become involved, and specific opportunities and contacts at local community colleges. The project will incorporate wide dissemination of results and sharing of best practices to recruit and retain under-served populations, focusing on students in economically disadvantaged high schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

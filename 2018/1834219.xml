<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the Mid-Atlantic Mathematical Logic Seminar (MAMLS), New England Recursion and Definability Seminar (NERDS), and Northeast Model Theory Days (NEMTD) conference series. These meetings will be held at various locations and cover a broad spectrum of modern mathematical logic, with particular emphasis on complexity theory, theoretical computer science, fragments of arithmetic, pure and applied model theory, proof theory, computability theory, set theory, subsystems of analysis, and topos theory. The organizers anticipate holding NERDS and NEMTD meetings twice each year, and the annual MAMLS meeting every autumn.  The first meeting held under the auspices of this grant will be the New England Recursion and Definability Seminar, in October 2018 at Wellesley College in Wellesley, Massachusetts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference series promotes modern mathematical logic and its applications to other areas of mathematics and beyond. The invited presentations provide opportunities for the discussion of the latest developments in the field, and the contributed talk sessions give graduate students and young researchers opportunities to present their own work, thereby contributing to their training and professional development. Financial support to attend the conference will preferentially be given to graduate students, postdocs, women, and minorities, as well as to junior faculty who may not otherwise be able to attend the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>This workshop brings together different approaches to studying political information and the way it is used by partisans on all sides of the political divide.  This will be done by bringing together experts from various fields such as Communications, Political Science, Social Psychology, etc.  These experts have addressed a number of different aspects of this topic from a variety of methodological and theoretical points of view.  Specifically, they will address what factors drive politically motivated perceptions?  How effective are correctives to misinformation?  The workshop would address these questions by bringing together experts from different disciplines/sub-disciplines who have addressed these questions in different ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the workshop are to structure intellectual change, clarify the state of the field, prioritize remaining questions, and chart a collaborative and efficient research agenda going forward.  The focus will be on distinguishing causal paths that impact the interpretations of political information, document its consequences, and evaluative ways to deal more efficiently with misinformation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

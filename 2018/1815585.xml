<AbstractNarration>Fine art objects such as paintings form a key part of our social and cultural heritage, but are inherently subject to degradation or damage. Conservation of these precious works incurs a huge cost, yet is vital if future generations are to have an opportunity to enjoy them and learn from them. Fortunately, high quality facsimiles of these cultural treasures can be exploited in place of the originals in many applications, including restoration practice, conservatory studies, education in museums, and enjoyment at home. This project will explore how to exploit an emerging generation of high-quality 3D printers to produce reproductions of fine art paintings that are of unprecedented quality by using not just a small number of inks (as with consumer-grade printers) but as many as 10 di&amp;#64256;erent inks to reproduce colors such that they are indistinguishable from the original to the human eye under various lighting conditions. Moreover, the use of these modern multi-material 3D printers will enable not just the reproduction of color but also the recreation of gloss, translucency, and &amp;#64257;ne-scale detail such as brush strokes. By creating the &amp;#64257;rst complete pipeline for realistic reproduction of &amp;#64257;ne art (with a focus on paintings), this project will lay the foundations for how &amp;#64257;ne art reproduction, in general, should be done using computational processes and 3D printers. This will lead to enabling technologies for reproduction and preservation of cultural heritage, allowing a wide population to enjoy favorite paintings in a form that is indistinguishable from the originals. Collaboration with local museums in Boston and Princeton will enable strong outreach with curators and the general public. Project outcomes will have additional broad impact by enabling accurate appearance reproduction with 3D printing in support of a wide range of applications in rapid prototyping and the manufacture of end-user products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To achieve these goals, the project will investigate several key methods and technologies. First, there is the question of how to use advanced camera systems to capture the properties of the original paintings. This involves measuring the full spectrum of light re&amp;#64258;ected by each point on the painting, as well as how shiny or opaque the surface is. Moreover, it involves the use of high-resolution 3D scanners to measure the &amp;#64257;ne bumps on the surface left by brushes or other tools. A second component of the project is to characterize the full capabilities of multi-material 3D printers, and to incorporate the measured ink properties into computer simulations that can predict exactly how the print-outs will look. The &amp;#64257;nal components of the project are to perform computer optimization to determine the exact type, number, and concentration of printing materials that should be used, and how the printing process should be tweaked to achieve maximum reproduction quality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

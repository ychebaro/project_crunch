<AbstractNarration>Internet of Things (IoT) marks the dawn of a technological revolution that rivals the industrial revolution. In this new era, intelligent computing becomes anticipatory, proactive, and adaptive. The next big growth in IoT systems will come from pushing Pervasive Personalized Intelligence (PPI) to the edge of the network, where latency is critical, and mobility, privacy, and context awareness are essential qualities of the application. This proposal will study the feasibility of establishing an industry university collaborative research center focused on PPI that enable an entirely new class of applications with intelligence that is predictive instead of reactive. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed PPI Center will enrich the educational resources and toolsets for adding, modernizing, tuning, and suggesting intelligence in software applications for the IoT. The Oregon State Site pursues activities under three thrusts. (1) ML and AI:  increasing the trust of developers and end-users in software that learns, detecting anomalous behaviors and patterns, on-boarding new users. (2) Security and Privacy: helping end-users make configuration decisions that do not violate their privacy, computing on users' private data without revealing private information. (3) Software Engineering and HCI: retrofitting PPI programming models into existing software, ensuring that PPI systems are inclusively designed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With their rich array of sensors, camera, and GPS all integrated in a convenient form, IoT devices offer exciting new applications and services, never before possible on consumer devices. But these can be harnessed only if intelligence becomes a commodity. PPI will enable novel applications that will help the U.S. maintain and expand its leadership in computing. The proposed Center is committed to broadening participation in computing through, for example, summer camps focusing on programming for novices. To improve the retention of underrepresented populations, the proposed Center will work with technology associations to showcase PPI applications that help humanity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Center on Pervasive Personalized Intelligence will be composed of Oregon State University, the University of Colorado Boulder, and industry partners. The proposed PPI Center will maintain a catalog of members, projects, meeting materials, program information, publications, data, code, and results at ppicenter.org. The website will be made available indefinitely or until the Center transitions to the next phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>Quantum computers enable calculations that are impractical on even the largest digital supercomputer. Current quantum computers are too small for us to show a clear advantage over conventional computers. This project will build a 32 qubit quantum computer that will enable scientists and computer scientists to test new algorithms for scientific computing and develop new software tools for optimizing and controlling quantum computers. This research instrument will enable the discovery of methods for scaling a future device to 100 qubits, where a clear advantage of quantum computers over conventional computers is expected to be demonstrated. It will also provide training opportunities for junior scientists and engineers needed for the growing quantum information industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 32 qubit quantum computer will be constructed from trapped atomic ions. The qubits will be stored in the long coherence hyperfine states of Ytterbium ions and the ions will be held using a surface electrode ion trap. All qubits will be individually addressed and two-qubit gates will be possible between any pair forming a fully-connected quantum computer. The instrument design builds off previous experience at Duke University and the University of Maryland constructing ion trap experiments. The  instrument developed in this project will allow for automated execution of algorithms and will serve as a research tool for physicists, chemists, and materials scientists interested in testing models of scientific computing with quantum computers and for computer scientists and system engineers to test programming methods and quantum abstractions. The research device will give users complete access and enable the development of novel user interfaces that would be difficult to test and implement on commercial quantum information devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

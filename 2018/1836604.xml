<AbstractNarration>Quantum mechanics is at the heart of 21st century science and technologies. To prepare a large and competent STEM workforce, instruction in quantum mechanics needs to reflect deep understandings of how people learn quantum mechanics. The project team will study how experts and novices visualize and conceptualize quantum systems. They will also study how people use and coordinate these understandings during complex quantum calculations. This research will produce new knowledge about three areas. The first area is how students and experts understand and use a variety of ways to represent quantum mechanical systems. The second area is how to best sequence representations in an approach that starts with the quantum mechanical idea of spin. This question will seek to find the approach that best supports development of correct student reasoning. The third area is how computational tools might support student learning in quantum mechanics. New research-based, student-centered instructional materials will be developed and tested in courses across the Paradigms in Physics program. This program is a national model for curricular reform that features a variety of active-engagement teaching strategies. The Paradigms in Physics program takes a spins-first approach to quantum mechanics, exploring the implications of the postulates of quantum mechanics while using simulations of quantum experiments to develop intuitions about quantum systems. The Paradigms in Physics program also features a computational physics lab that is coordinated with the main courses. This addition will allow students to harness the power of computation to explore and understand physical systems. This project is aligned with the discipline-based education research agenda recently set by The National Research Council: research conducted in a sequence of upper-division courses at the intersection of math, physics, and computer science with learning environments that promote problem-solving, metacognition, and visualization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major focus of this project is the development of a learning progression for quantum mechanics, by documenting the evolution of student understanding of the fundamental concepts and representations used in quantum mechanics as they progress through the upper-division physics major. Problem-solving interviews will be conducted with both experts and students to establish levels and pathways in the learning progression. Real-time student learning will be documented with videos of students working collaboratively in class and analyzed using rigorous qualitative research methods. The learning progression will be documented graphically on a public, interactive website, including information about instructional materials, sequences of concepts &amp; representations, and supporting research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamic &amp; Mechanism B Program of the Chemistry Division, is to demonstrate the storage and/or processing of quantum information in a single goblet-shaped magnetic molecule deposited on a surface and controlled electrically.  Quantum information processing could lead to quantum computers, which could be more powerful than the current computers.  Quantum information processing is also important in secure communication and precision measurement.  Samples resulting from this research will be widely distributed to the spintronics community to support the expansion of the fields of molecular spintronics and molecule-based quantum computing.  Students from diverse backgrounds, from high-school to PhD candidate level, will be involved in the project, giving them the opportunity to acquire competences not only in chemistry but also in material science and physics.  They will be well prepared to enter the workforce on quantum computing.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, f-block elements, with their strong magnetic anisotropy, are excellent spin quantum bit candidates. The molecules designed for this project take the shape of a goblet, with a tricyclopentadienyl bowl holding a lanthanoid ion, a stem of tunable length and rigidity and an aromatic foot ensuring a strong interaction with a metallic surface. Taking advantage of this modular architecture, an extensive investigation of the structure-properties relationship will be conducted from the bulk state down to the single molecule level. The decoupling of the magnetic center from the underlying surface is expected to protect its magnetic characteristics and make them accessible to a top electrode or the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope. This type of setup opens the door to the realization of a single molecule spin filter or, on a ferromagnetic surface, a molecular spin valve, which paves the way to the construction of electrically addressable single molecule spin quantum bits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in their efforts to significantly increase the numbers of students matriculating into and successfully completing high quality degree programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines to diversify the STEM workforce.  Particular emphasis is placed on transforming undergraduate STEM education through innovative, evidence-based recruitment and retention strategies, and relevant educational experiences in support of racial and ethnic groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines: African Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders.  These strategies facilitate the production of well-prepared students highly-qualified and motivated to pursue graduate education or careers in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the United States (U.S.) to remain globally competitive, it is vital that it taps into the talent of all its citizens and provides exceptional educational preparedness in STEM areas that underpin the knowledge-based economy.  The Islands of Opportunity Alliance (IOA) program was established in 2006 in response to the need for a more diverse and skilled technical workforce.  That need still exists and is particularly acute in the State of Hawaii.  IOA is composed of 11 university and community college partners across the western Pacific, spanning nine distinct language-speaking communities.  As a LSAMP STEM Pathways and Research Alliance, the goals of the IOA are to: 1) increase the overall number of Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander students graduating with baccalaureate degrees in STEM and pursuing graduate degrees or entering a STEM career; and 2) investigate how Pacific culture-normed understandings of belonging, motivation, attainment, and success can enculturate western STEM education initiatives.  These goals support the National Science Foundation's strategic goal to "cultivate a world-class, broadly inclusive science and engineering workforce, and expand the scientific literacy of all citizens."  In support of the goals, the alliance-wide activities consist of culture-based STEM curricula enhancements; intrusive academic advising; organized student learning communities; peer tutoring and gateway course support; student recruitment, retention, and culturally-based outreach activities; summer bridge programs; research experiences; and conference and workshops.  The research study to design more efficacious STEM programs will contribute to cross-cultural understandings of belonging, motivation, attachment, and success in STEM in the U.S. affiliated Pacific.  This can be used as the basis for enhanced dialog with other indigenous cultures in the U.S.  Native American/Alaskan Natives share similar customs and values centered on family and community, geographic isolation, histories of colonization, and contemporary revitalization movements.  Sharing views of STEM success across the cultures of the IOA and other indigenous cultures within the U.S. will strengthen the well-being of these communities and contribute to the nation?s scientific progress; and moreover, lead to a more talented and diverse STEM workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

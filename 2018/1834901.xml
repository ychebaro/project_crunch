<AbstractNarration>This award supports the attendance of students and postdoctoral fellows at the 14th Congress of the International Society for Developmental and Comparative Immunology in Santa Fe, NM on June 17 - 21, 2018. The Congress enhances research in immunology through presentations of current research and discussions of immune function in a wide variety of organisms. Comparative and evolutionary studies of the immune responses in non-mammalian species have led to groundbreaking work, such as the identification of the function of receptors in pathogen recognition and host defense. These immune strategies have been major discoveries that have advanced the wider field of immunology. The Congress will promote discussion between early career scientists and students with leaders in the field of comparative immunology, providing valuable opportunities for young scientists to interact with them and establish professional networks essential to their careers. Understanding how different animals respond to infections can enhance knowledge of human responses to infections and potentially lead to new therapies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 14th Congress of the International Society for Developmental and Comparative Immunology brings together scientists who study the immune systems of different species.  Studies of comparative immunology have led to groundbreaking discoveries such as Toll-like receptors and RNAi as a host defense mechanism. The conference is designed to maximize formal and informal interaction between scientists at all levels. Supported participants will submit a summary of a session of their choosing. These reports will be compiled into a meeting report that will be published and disseminated through publication in the ISDCI journal, Developmental and Comparative Immunology. Organizers have a commitment to gender balance and encourage attendance by underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

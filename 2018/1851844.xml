<AbstractNarration>This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site award to East Carolina University, located in Greenville, NC, supports the training of 10 undergraduate students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2019-2021. This program, funded by the Division of Chemistry, engages participants in research in the fields of chemistry and biochemistry, ranging from experimental research to computational studies.  All students work with experienced faculty mentors. In addition to research, the undergraduate students take part in professional development activities, which are structured to foster knowledge of research ethics and intellectual property, enhance communication skills, and increase chances for success in higher education and STEM careers. The REU experience motivates the participants to consider graduate studies and a research career in chemistry-related fields, enhancing the academic and technical workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In collaboration with their peers and faculty mentors,  undergraduate participants contribute to research projects in the fields of metal catalysis, bio-catalysis, synthetic methodology, metal ion-protein interactions, protein-ligand interactions, and protein-protein interactions. This site emphasizes recruitment of students that are underrepresented in the chemical sciences and students with limited opportunities for research. Participants gain skills in using modern scientific research tools, develop a strong ability to critically analyze scientific literature, and design and execute experiments, along with substantial skills in written and oral communication for various audiences. The site promotes the next generation of a diverse and well-trained STEM workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical Abstract: There is a demand for a fault-tolerant implementation of quantum information processing that is immune from mistakes that occur during the course of computation. Such an information processor may be built using topological materials as a computing platform. The goal of this project is to demonstrate such a computing platform using states that have been predicted in certain semiconductor devices that realize a unique form of a quantum phenomenon called fractional quantum Hall effect, leading to topological qubit. A successful development of topological qubit can help revolutionize the field of quantum computation and produce a significant speed up of certain types of computations such as an efficient database search and simulation of quantum systems. The research project will help train a new generation of students on the concepts and techniques of an emerging frontier of quantum science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical abstract: Topological quantum computing is a potentially enabling technology that has emerged from study of condensed matter physics in recent years. The fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE), realized in high quality semiconductor structures at low temperatures and high magnetic fields, is a promising template for realization of topological qubit. Quantum information in a topological qubit is stored in non-Abelian anyons which have been predicted for the FQHE states that occurs at 5/2 filling factor. Demonstration of topological qubits based on braiding of non-Abelian anyons of the 5/2 FQHE state is proposed. The goal is to advance the experimental techniques for detection and measurement of low energy excitations that lies at the heart of this emerging paradigm. A successful measurement of the statistical phase angle of anyonic excitations of the FQHE liquids in electronic Fabry-Perot interferometers fabricated from high mobility GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures will set the stage for the demonstration of topological qubit. A successful demonstration of the logical gates will establish the protected topological qubit in these systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

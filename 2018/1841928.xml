<AbstractNarration>As a result of the powerful innovation and application of computing in STEM disciplines, the STEM+C program addresses an urgent need for real-world, interdisciplinary, and computational preparation of students from the early grades through high school (preK-12). This project will advance research and development of new transdisciplinary approaches to computational STEM teaching and learning that will integrate computational thinking through data visualizations, the scientific practice of argumentation from evidence, and earth science concepts focused on geohazards. The team will develop a open-source scaffolded programming tool for data visualizations, and two curricular modules on geohazards for middle and high school aligned with Next Generation Science Standards. Integration of computational thinking and science practices will occur as students transform real-world GPS data into manageable and interpretative visualizations using the programming tool and use them as evidence to formulate scientific arguments about predicting the impact of geohazards. The resulting products can serve as exemplars for curriculum developers, researchers, and educators to integrate computational data visualization practices with disciplinary STEM learning, and inform strategies to support teachers and students when implementing these practices. This project is supported by the STEM + Computing Program that advances research and development of interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches to the integration of computing within science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) teaching and learning for preK-12 students in both formal and informal settings. STEM+C supports research on how students learn to think computationally to solve interdisciplinary problems in the STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The examination of the integrated geohazard units with the scaffolded programming tool for data visualization will take place in two phases. First, design-based research will be conducted to refine the tool and curriculum modules, develop assessments for students' content learning and argumentation practices, and identify teacher supports necessary for implementing this type of curriculum module in classroom.  Second, a delayed cohort pre-post-test design will investigate the impact of integrating the computational practice of data visualization on student learning. The project will reach 800 students and 12 teachers, and be implemented in a wide range of schools including those that serve underrepresented students in STEM.  Developed products and research findings will be widely disseminated to practitioners, developers, and researchers in the fields of science education, geosciences, educational technology, and learning sciences&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

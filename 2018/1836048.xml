<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in a conference on commutative algebra, KUMUNU 2018, which will be held at the University of Kansas, Lawrence, Oct 13-14, 2018. KUMUNU (which is named for its original participating institutions: the University of Kansas, the University of Missouri, Columbia, and the University of Nebraska, Lincoln) is an annual conference (held since 1999) for commutative algebraists in the Great Plains region. Major goals specific to KUMUNU 2018 are to broaden the geographic reach of the conference, promote a connection between commutative algebra and related areas, and showcase the research of early career mathematicians. To promote connections between commutative algebra and other areas, talks from some experts on tropical geometry, convex geometry, and optimization are included. The conference will also include a poster session for junior researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The general goal of KUMUNU is to provide a setting to share cutting-edge mathematical research and promote collaborations among algebraists in or within driving distance of the Great Plains region. KUMUNU 2018 aims to advance mathematics through the dissemination of new and innovative results and techniques via research talks. These talks are intended to inspire participating mathematicians and promote collaboration. Invited speakers are David Eisenbud (University of California), Raymond Heitmann (University of Texas), Siamak Yassemi (University of Tehran), Ryo Takahashi (Nagoya University), Jason McCullough (Iowa State University), Parangarma Sarkar (University of Missouri), Kyungyong Lee (University of Nebraska).  Informal discussions between talks will help spread new results and ideas. Talks will be held from noon on Saturday to noon on Sunday, thereby minimizing expenses for participants. Award funds will defray one night's accommodation and travel expenses, with an emphasis on support of graduate students and early-career researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

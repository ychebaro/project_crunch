<AbstractNarration>Gamma-rays are the highest energy form of electromagnetic radiation.  Observations of astrophysical gamma-rays serve as probes of physical conditions and processes in the most extreme environments throughout the Universe and can be used to test fundamental physics. The Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS), located in southern Arizona, is designed to perform high-sensitivity pointed observations of both galactic and extragalactic sources.  This award supports scientists at California State University East Bay (CSUEB) in their work on VERITAS.  Dr. Furniss and her group will analyze VERITAS data to study high-energy gamma-ray emitting galaxies and probe the extragalactic magnetic fields that permeate the Universe.  This project will directly engage undergraduates in particle astrophysics research.  Students involved in the project will visit the VERITAS observatory and contribute to on-site operations and data collection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CSUEB group will collect and utilize VERITAS observations of very high-energy emitting active galaxies to study extragalactic gamma-ray photon propagation.  The group will contribute to the first VERITAS extragalactic catalog of these sources.  The isotropy of gamma-ray galaxies will be tested, and the location of the sources with respect to the integrated mass density along the source lines-of-sight will be characterized using publicly available catalogs.  A theoretical connection between the extragalactic magnetic fields along the lines of sight to detected sources will be investigated through the use of simulations of extragalactic gamma-ray initiated cascades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

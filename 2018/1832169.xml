<AbstractNarration>The Academic Career Mentoring Workshop series targets faculty (assistant professors and associate professors), senior graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers in computing from the following underrepresented groups: African American, Hispanic, Native American, and People with Disabilities.  The series started in 2005 and has been funded by NSF grants from 2007 through 2017.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will involve the following activities:&lt;br/&gt;Organize workshops for 2018 through 2020; for each workshop, conduct a thorough evaluation of the workshop; leverage the workshop attendees and the newly-formed FLIP (Diversifying Future Leadership in the Professoriate) Alliance to extend the annual evaluation to consider the factors that influence the decisions to pursue academic careers; and at the end of the project, conduct a longitudinal evaluation of the program for 2010 through 2020.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

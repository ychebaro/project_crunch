<AbstractNarration>The underrepresentation of minorities in STEM fields, and geosciences in particular, can be addressed through concerted and sustained efforts to broaden participation of these groups. With an eye towards understanding why so few minority students choose to go into this interdisciplinary field and subsequent careers (NSF Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2018-2022; NSF Advisory Committee for Geosciences, December 2014), efforts are needed to both galvanize critical stakeholders and create connection points for students and faculty to on-ramp to the geosciences. The need to prepare and support faculty to teach geosciences courses and to support institutions in creating pathways and programs to broaden participation in the geoscience workforce is more critical now than ever. Institutional and professional capacity to serve students from underrepresented groups is critical to the nation's economic competitiveness, especially as job growth of up to 10% is expected for the geosciences by 2024 (Wilson, 2016). This Maximizing Geosciences Opportunities Through Interdisciplinary Engagement and Outreach workshop recognizes that challenges and opportunities to broadening participation of HBCU institutions in geosciences exist at all educational levels, and therefore the goal will be to leverage participants thought leadership and expertise to develop and launch a HBCU Geosciences Action Plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The grand challenges and opportunities of 21st century geosciences require transdisciplinary, integrative and collaborative approaches. The National Technical Association, partnering with the HBCU-Geoscience Working Group, is able to broaden its reach and develop keener insight to support the untapped resources of HBCUs. Some key goals for this workshop are to 1) develop and present an HBCU Geosciences Action Plan Framework, 2) forge an official collaborative partnership between the National Technical Association and the HBCU Geosciences Working Group, and 3) produce an outline for an HBCU Geosciences Workshop Series Synthesis Report. Potential outcomes of the workshop include: a) promotion of interdisciplinary, culturally relevant and intergenerational perspectives that help build and sustain HBCU institutional geoscience teaching, research, community engagement, public policy and workforce development capacities, and b) encourage a greater commitment to building opportunities for strategic and integrated geoscience initiatives at the faculty, undergraduate and graduate levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

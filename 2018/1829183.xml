<AbstractNarration>NSF support is provided for a workshop on "The Art of Measuring Physical Parameters in Galaxies" to be held during April 10-13th 2018 at the Palm Desert conference center of the University of California, Riverside. This workshop builds upon and extends the successful Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) project. The award will help support attendance of 20 younger astronomers and members of the minority groups.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is now an extensive photometric and spectroscopic dataset available for CANDELS galaxies, driving a need to measure their associated physical parameters. The aim of the workshop is to bring together leaders in the field to discuss and identify the optimum ways to measure these parameters using the combined data from X-ray to radio wavelengths, to discuss the state-of-the-art science, and to identify the outstanding and fundamental projects that are only possible by exploiting such data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>This project stimulates scientific interest in an existing facility and dataset developed in part by the National Science Foundation (NSF), Office of Polar Programs. This facility consists of 58 Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers located around the rocky coastline of Greenland, many of which have been collecting data nearly continuously for more than 10 years. This project fosters new and innovative research from these data by reaching out to science communities that include GPS experts and non-experts, or scientists that have not traditionally used GPS in their research. The investigators are increasing awareness of the facility and dataset and making the dataset more easily accessible. This project is important because it encourages innovative science from an existing large dataset that represents substantial investment of time, logistics, and funding by the NSF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Greenland Geodetic Network (GNET) is currently jointly managed by the US and Denmark. This project is developing a Research Networking Activity aimed at encouraging innovative scientific research from the existing GNET dataset. The project specifically 1) broadens community awareness of, and engagement with, the GNET resource through the development of a data portal; 2) encourages new and innovative use of these data with the guidance of a scientific Steering Committee that includes researchers both internal and external to the GPS community; and 3) provides guidance for continued GNET research and network maintenance based on input from the Steering Committee and community feedback, obtained at international conferences. The objective of these activities is to make GNET data more accessible to GPS experts and non-experts, with the express purpose of encouraging the science community to pose and answer new questions associated with this unmatched dataset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

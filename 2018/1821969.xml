<AbstractNarration>The 2018 North American Summer School in Logic, Language, and Information (NASSLLI) will be held at Carnegie Mellon University from June 23-June 29, 2018. This program has been providing outstanding interdisciplinary educational opportunities to graduate students and advanced undergraduates in logic, linguistics, computer science, cognitive science, and philosophy since it was launched as a biennial event in 2002. NASSLLI brings these disciplines together with the goal of producing excellence in the study of how minds and machines accomplish the tasks of representing, communicating, manipulating and reasoning with information. NASSLLI represents a community which recognizes that advances in modeling and analyzing the performance of these tasks, as well as automating them, requires the contributions of multiple inter-related disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NASSLLI 2018 will feature a set of intensive introductory courses offered over the initial weekend of the summer school, followed by a variety of weeklong courses and workshops in five parallel sessions: Logic and Epistemology; Logic and Computation; Computational Linguistics; Semantics and Pragmatics; and Explorations. The weeklong courses will range from high level introductions to a topic to more specialized courses for students with appropriate background. These combined offerings expand beyond those typically offered at academic institutions, and offer students exposure to new topics and approaches. The teaching faculty are all accomplished researchers, coming from top institutions in the United States and overseas. Attendance at NASSLLI thus provides students with the opportunity of interacting with faculty doing work at the cutting edge of the fields represented at the school. The summer school also provides students with the opportunity to present their own work at daily poster sessions. All of these opportunities make NASSLLI a unique venue for training the next generation of researchers in the areas of logic, language and information, providing them with the requisite tools to conduct innovative and groundbreaking research, and creating connections among them. Funding will provide fellowships for selected graduate student participants to defray the costs of accommodation and travel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

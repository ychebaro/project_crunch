<AbstractNarration>Applications in modern cloud datacenters are deployed in resource containers to isolate them from each other. Memory stranding is a pervasive problem in such containerized datacenters, where many memory-intensive applications grind to a halt even when free memory exists in other machines. This leads to low utilization, memory fragmentation, and overall increased cost. Memory disaggregation over ultra-fast networks can pool together such stranded memory in theory, but making it practical faces novel systems design, algorithmic, and integration challenges. They include bridging the still-sizable latency gap between local memory access vs. Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA), transparently addressing network-wide fault-tolerance, load imbalance, and performance isolation issues, scalability, and enabling support for heterogeneous software and hardware technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching research objective of this proposal is to realize a Unified Disaggregated Memory (UDM) abstraction over ultra-fast networks to expose stranded memory across the datacenter as a pool of available memory to out-of-memory containers in a fast, resilient, and scalable manner without any changes to the applications. By designing a comprehensive solution to address host-level, network-level, and end-to-end aspects of the aforementioned challenges, this research aims to make memory disaggregation practical. Specifically, by leveraging the unique characteristics of memory-intensive workloads, ultra-low-latency networks, and multi-tenancy in modern datacenters, this proposal will (i) design a low-latency host networking stack; (ii) enable performance isolation throughout the network; (iii) provide resilience to network-wide uncertainties such as failures and load imbalance; and (iv) incorporate support for heterogeneous memory (e.g., persistent memory), networking technologies, and resource management software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

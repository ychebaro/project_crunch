<AbstractNarration>The proposed project seeks financial support for enhancing graduate student participation, especially those who will attend their first national meeting and those who belong to the underrepresented groups at a Conference to be held from July 7 to 12, 2019 at Bellevue Washington. The "13th International Conference on Nitride Semiconductors" will focus on a variety of III-Nitride semiconductor materials and devices. The Conference will host world-renowned experts from leading institutions around the world. An exhibition of industrial expertise related to nitride semiconductor research will also take place at the conference. The conference will foster advances in the leading research of electronic, photonic and magnetic devices. Examples of them include Light Emitting Devices (LEDs, LEDs, Laser Diodes, UV, VIS, IR); Electronic Devices (RF, THz and Power Devices); Photovoltaics, Energy Harvesting and Photo Detectors Sensors; Actuators and Acoustic Devices.  Processing, Fabrication and Thermal Management; Bulk Growth; Epitaxial Growth; Nanostructures and Nano-Devices; Optical and Electronic Properties; Defect Characterization and Engineering; Structural Analysis; Theory and Simulation; and New Materials and Device Concepts will also be addressed. In addition to technical talks, the organizers have also planned several plenary talks as well as 20 invited talks and two poster sessions. There will be short 4-hour courses focused on important topics of III-N research, including X-ray diffraction of GaN-related materials and simulation and modeling of GaN LEDs and HEMTs. The conference is expected to play a key role in identifying new directions for research. Exposing the next generation of researchers to these important disciplines is critical for learning how the new science and technology of semiconductors are developing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

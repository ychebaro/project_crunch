<AbstractNarration>Biological systems are extremely diverse and complex, possessing enormous variation. Understanding the mechanisms by which biological systems work is one of the fundamental scientific challenges of our time. Rules of Life offer principles - which are broadly applicable across bacteria, plants, and animals - that can be the basis for organized research programs that address the challenge of understanding nature. Unlike a traditional workshop or conference, the format of the Summit is designed to build interdisciplinary connections through provocative talks, panel discussions, and focused break-out sessions. Additionally, talks on emerging technologies and methods will broaden the perspectives of participants who may not have prior exposure to these tools.  The two follow-up workshops will encourage participants to plan how connections made at the Summit can be long lasting and lead to concrete outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mathematical Biosciences Institute (MBI) will organize a Summit on the Rules of Life in June 2019. This project will support the development of a networked community of researchers seeking to better understand the fundamental mechanisms that govern biological systems.  This community will be convened at a Summit on the Rules of Life held at the Mathematical Biosciences Institute in Columbus, OH.  Prominent biological scientists from across the world, together with newer researchers and individuals with expertise in emerging technologies and mathematical/statistical methodologies, will jointly explore the common principles that govern biological systems.  Video of the plenary lectures, panel discussions, and emerging technologies/methods talks delivered at the Summit will be live streamed and archived on the MBI website for later viewing.  The Summit will lead to two shorter follow-up workshops on emerging themes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

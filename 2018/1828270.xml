<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;One of the core elements of modern science is to acquire structural information from a broad range of length scales including the scale of atoms, molecules, and nanostructures to solar systems and galaxies. Imaging methods in real space play an ever-increasing role in structure analysis. From the acquired information, it is then possible to build theoretical models that can explain the underlying phenomena. In the case of nanoscience and materials research, imaging structures and properties has led to revolutionary progress in nanotechnology, information technology, and biotechnology, particularly after the invention of electron and scanning-probe microscopy, for which Nobel prizes were awarded in 1986. This grant allows purchase of a cutting-edge microscopy system with extreme sample environments to further advance the boundary of science in terms of elucidating the underlying mechanisms of complex material properties on the nanometer scale. The outcome of the research carried out using the microscopy system is expected to have important impacts on the applications of many mechanical, electrical, magnetic, and energy materials. The microscopy system also provides training opportunities on the state-of-the-art microscopy instrument for a large group of graduate and undergraduate students and postdoctoral researchers and help promote public awareness of the importance of nanoscience and nanotechnology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;This project acquires a state-of-the-art, multifunctional, low-temperature, high-magnetic-field scanning probe microscopy system at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and enables broad usage of the system for nanoscale science and engineering research. The system is capable of characterizing spatially resolved conductivity, magnetic force, piezoresponse force, and topography down to the nanoscale. The system is equipped with an ultra-low-vibration sample environment that offers a wide range of temperature and magnetic fields. Building on the versatile capabilities of the system, this instrument enables research projects that explore: 1) the morphology, electric transport, magnetism, and ferroelectricity on nanoscale and low-dimensional materials; 2) the coupling between these properties; 3) material properties that emerge only at extreme conditions, as well as the related thermodynamic phase transitions; and 4) quantum phase transitions in electric and/or magnetic fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

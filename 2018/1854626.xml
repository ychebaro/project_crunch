<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in three meetings of the Texas-Oklahoma Representations and Automorphic Forms (TORA) conference series.  The tenth meeting of the series will be held at the University of North Texas in Denton, TX, on April 5-7, 2019.  Detailed information is available on the TORA X webpage: http://www.math.unt.edu/~richter/TORA/TORA10.html .  The subsequent two conferences in the series are scheduled at Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, OK in Spring 2020 and at the University of Oklahoma in Norman, OK in Spring 2021, respectively.  Each TORA conference will feature three invited plenary speakers from outside the Texas-Oklahoma region: two prominent senior researchers and one promising junior mathematician.  In addition, regional graduate students and researchers will present their work.  These weekend conferences will provide valuable opportunities for collaboration and interaction among the students and researchers in the region specializing in number theory, automorphic forms, and representation theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interplay between automorphic forms and representation theory has recently seen several exciting new developments, which also fuel applications to several other fields.  These developments include endoscopic classification of representations of orthogonal and symplectic groups and a proof of classification for classical groups that extends to covering groups.  The TORA conference series has been successful in bringing together researchers working in automorphic forms and representation theory from the region and beyond, as well as their students, and in propelling innovation and collaboration.  TORA X-XII will continue this success in collaborations and exchanges not only between institutions, but also among mathematical areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

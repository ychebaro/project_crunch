<AbstractNarration>Human trafficking poses a grave threat to national and international security of many countries, including the United States. Human trafficking is the criminal commercial exchange and exploitation of humans for monetary gain or benefit, and is a prevalent and malicious human rights issue as well as a driver of transnational crime. Because human trafficking occurs within illicit supply  networks that are hidden from the public eye, insights into the structure and characteristics of human trafficking networks are currently limited. Operations research models have the potential to dramatically improve our ability to disrupt human trafficking networks by increasing the efficiency of limited anti-trafficking resources, but their impact remains largely dormant and unexplored, as the structure and linkages of human trafficking networks is little understood.  This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) will address operational methods to understand and mitigate human trafficking by studying border control and transit center intercept data to identify key aspects of labor and sex trafficking networks from the perspective of traffickers and victims. The data analysis and operational methods will be developed and evaluated by a transdisciplinary team of operations research, human trafficking, and law enforcement experts. New insights into the composition of both labor and sex trafficking networks will enhance related analytical models by better understanding the similarities and key differences with traditional supply chain networks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support research to formulate high fidelity spatiotemporal analytical models of cross-border human trafficking networks. The methods developed will combine data science and social science approaches and will incorporate different geographic and social network topologies, accounting for regional, cultural and population heterogeneity. Six years of cross-border interception data has been collected, consisting of over 350 data fields with detailed victim and trafficker demographic information, origin and destination points, recruitment methods and transit routes. Analytical results will be informed by qualitative ethnographic techniques that describe recruitment tactics, and regional and cultural nuances. Insights from this analysis will serve as platforms on which to construct context-informed models for operations researchers working in the domain of human trafficking, and are expected to help inform policy makers that oversee resource allocation in border control and law enforcement agencies, as well as  anti-trafficking organizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>With support from the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program, this Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project aims to serve the national need of increasing the number of highly qualified, culturally-responsive secondary STEM teachers in high-need school districts. Urban areas across the nation struggle with recruitment and retention of teachers, particularly for STEM content areas. This Noyce project will offer undergraduate STEM students supplementary research opportunities throughout their degree program to expand their skill set as educators. Other project highlights include seminars with an Educational Studies Scholar-In-Residence, as well as professional development for Noyce scholars once they are teachers.  These supports will be supplemented by training teachers to understand the impact of culture on student learning.  This training will be analyzed as part of a research study that was designed to develop a model for improving teaching in high-need urban school districts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The four project goals include: (1) recruiting 18 STEM majors to become Noyce scholars; (2) retaining Noyce scholars in high-need school districts after completion of the Noyce program; (3) preparing Noyce scholars to effectively implement culturally relevant practices in their STEM instruction; and (4) institutionalizing the supplemental (non-scholarship) project components. Project activities and supports will span the five-year project, beginning in each scholar's junior year and continuing through induction supports in the first years of teaching. To broaden the project's impact, the leadership team will research the correlation between culturally-relevant training and teacher retention as the scholars graduate and become STEM teachers in high-need school districts. Thus, the project's outcomes will contribute to identifying replicable academic experiences and evidence-based models for successful STEM teacher education that can be shared with other institutions. In turn, the project has the potential to influence teacher education and retention for urban, high-need districts nationwide. The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 mathematics and science teachers in high-need school districts and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>Movement of individual cells can be guided by a variety of cues, including chemical signals and mechanical forces, and is critically important for a multitude of processes, ranging from embryonic development to proper function of the immune system. Studies in the well-established model organism, social amoeba Dictyostelium, have demonstrated that directed movement is orchestrated by a vast network of molecular pathways that are activated in response to the chemical or mechanical signals. Similar molecular pathways have also been observed in mammalian cells that utilize amoeboid-type movement, such as white blood cells and metastatic tumor cells. To better understand the molecular networks controlling cell to surface attachment in directed cell movement of amoeboid cells, this research will examine interactions between known regulators of cell attachment,identify new players in the process, and explore the role of mechanical forces and their transmission to the molecular network in directed movement in Dictyostelium cells. This research will provide training opportunities for many undergraduate students performing primary research either in the investigator's laboratory, or in a course-based setting, as well as high school students from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds. Students will gain hands-on experience in current techniques in molecular and cell biology and biochemistry, and will develop valuable critical thinking and scientific reasoning skills. To further promote higher education in STEM-related fields in the upcoming generation, this program also includes hosting visits of preschool and high school students to SUNY Oswego, where they can directly interact with and learn from the students conducting primary research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chemotaxis, or migration in a chemoattractant gradient, is the best understood mode of directed cell migration, and involves activation of multiple signal transduction pathways downstream of a chemoattractant receptor, leading to biased actin polymerization. In contrast to chemotaxis, detailed mechanisms of shear flow-induced migration are not known. Furthermore, the role of cell-substrate adhesion during directed cell migration in cells that utilize amoeboid-type migration is unclear. The hypothesis of this study is that in addition to its involvement in overall directed migration, cell-substrate adhesion plays a unique role in the initiation of and directional sensing during shear flow-induced migration. Using an established model system for amoeboid-type motility, Dictyostelium discoideum, this research will investigate the interplay between adhesion and directed cell migration in two ways. First, this study will test the genetic and molecular interaction between Rap1/Phg2, a known pathway that controls adhesion in Dictyostelium, and a new regulator of adhesion and chemotaxis, KrsB. A suppressor screen will also be conducted in a course-based setting to identify potentially novel KrsB partners. Second, this project will examine the effects of various perturbations in cell substrate adhesion and its coupling to the actin cytoskeleton on the initial response to shear flow. Taken together, this study will greatly expand the understanding of the signal transduction events involved in non-integrin based adhesion and its role in directed cell migration to various cues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

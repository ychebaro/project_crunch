<AbstractNarration>Ecology and evolution are two significant biological processes that are often studied independently. Yet, it is likely that interactions between ecology and evolution are key to generating biological diversity. This project will study toxic algal blooms to understand how links between ecological and evolutionary processes shape biodiversity. The last decade has seen amazing advances in genome sequencing technology and biological data analysis. There is now an opportunity to apply this new technology to the study of algae. Algae are important for several reasons. Algae are the primary producers in most ocean and freshwater environments. Algae produce numerous substances including antibiotics and other potential human drugs. Algae also produce toxins that endanger human health and water quality. These toxic algal blooms are increasing in both frequency and severity across the globe. The resources developed as a result of this project will help better predict toxic algal blooms. This project will train undergraduate students in genomics and phylogenetic approaches. Outreach materials focused on the algae in aquarium habitats will also be developed for the Biosphere 2 facility in Arizona.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to study a type of toxic alga called Prymnesium. Prymnesium is abundant in aquatic communities in Texas. The project will focus on study sites in Texas. The project will test the hypothesis that changes in toxicity shape the genetic diversity of Prymnesium populations. To do so, the project will first characterize the diversity of toxic algal blooms through whole genome sequencing of over 100 diverse Prymnesium strains. This will be the largest survey of genomic variation within a natural algal population to date. Second, the project will identify the molecular mechanisms of toxicity using RNA sequencing and network analysis. This approach will overcome the challenge of rapid, accurate identification of genes underlying functional traits. Third, the researchers will integrate the empirical data into mathematical models of eco-evolutionary feedbacks to predict all three dimensions (genetic, phylogenetic, and function) of biodiversity within toxic algal blooms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

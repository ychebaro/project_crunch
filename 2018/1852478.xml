<AbstractNarration>This award provides renewed funding for one year for the longstanding Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at Northern Arizona University (NAU) and Lowell Observatory. Ten student participants per year will be paired with NAU and Lowell scientists to conduct astrophysics research into a wide variety of topics, including lunar impact craters, cryogenic outer solar system ices, near-earth objects, and exoplanets. In addition, the students will attend biweekly seminars to learn more about professional astrophysics, responsible research conduct, and applying to graduate school. The Site will also introduce students to cutting-edge telescopes, including Lowell's Discovery Channel Telescope and the Naval Precision Optical Interferometer. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By offering high-quality research experiences to students at a critical stage of undergraduate education, the REU Site will contribute to increasing the nationwide pool of scientists and engineers. Participants will develop the research methods and analytical skills (mathematical, computational, and logical) necessary to process data, understand primary research, and to remain current with new developments in the field. The REU Site also has an active and highly developed plan to recruit underrepresented minorities into its program, which will expand STEM training opportunities to these groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>PART 1: NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plastics that are derived from petroleum typically do not degrade with time and eventually end up in landfills. The proposed work will use specific biosourced and biodegradable plastics and process them to obtain conducting composites, thereby extending their use to electronic applications.  By confining the synthesis to two dimensions, the principal investigator (PI) will also explore synthesis of conducting plastic materials with fewer defects that may possess higher intrinsic conductivity. Using these materials, the PI plans to fabricate fibers having diameters roughly one-thousandth that of a human hair using an electrospinning technique.  Devices and sensors fabricated from these fibers may then have superior operating properties compared to those prepared from thicker films of the same material. For example, sensors may be able to detect toxic gases at low concentrations and higher speeds. The planned research is interdisciplinary involving materials science, physics, chemistry, nanoscience, and electronics. Students will be trained in multiple disciplines thereby preparing them to enter the workforce with a diverse set of skills. This project will also focus on educating and mentoring undergraduates, recruiting students, and conducting outreach in science and engineering.  It will thus increase the number of research-experienced undergraduates from underrepresented groups in science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator (PI) will work with sustainable polymers that are biosourced and biodegradable and render them usable for electroactive applications via fabrication of composites with conducting polymers. In addition, he plans to synthesize conducting polymers in a confined environment, where in-situ confinement during polymerization may lead to fewer chain defects and ultimately higher intrinsic conductivity. Besides thin films, nanofibers of the electro-active polymers will also be fabricated and characterized via temperature-dependent charge transport and dielectric relaxation studies. Nanofibers naturally possess a confined environment for charge flow, and studies on such fibers may lead to reduced defects. The results from the fundamental research on charge transport and charge relaxation will be used to prepare devices and sensors with superior operating characteristics. The planned research includes an interdisciplinary combination of materials science, physics, chemistry, nanoscience and electronics. It will provide undergraduates with a sound research experience thereby preparing them to enter the workforce with a diverse set of skills. This project will also focus on educating and mentoring undergraduates, recruiting students, and conducting outreach in science and engineering.  It will thus increase the number of research-experienced undergraduates from underrepresented groups in science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

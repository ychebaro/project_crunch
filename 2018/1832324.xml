<AbstractNarration>This proposal is to fund student travel to the Security and Human Behavior (SHB) workshop to be held in May 2018 at Carnegie Mellon University.  The goals of SHB are to discuss, in an informal and interdisciplinary setting, issues where security, psychology, and behavior interact. The scope is broad: topics that have been covered in the past include the misperception of risk, security usability, deception, security and privacy decision making, and so forth. As the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) research program has expanded to include social sciences in addition to its core in computer science, gatherings such as SHB provide a key venue for interaction between the different communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students from U.S. universities, or U.S. students from other universities, will greatly benefit from participating in the workshop, where they will interact with research leaders from a variety of disciplines and will be exposed to the most recent developments in information security and privacy research. In particular, the first rule of the SHB Workshop is that everyone who attends actually participates in the discussion. This will ensure that students get more value from attending SHB than many conferences and workshops where they can simply listen. Further, the organizers will ask invited senior scholars for suggestions of student participants who are from underrepresented groups to invite, increasing the chance that the workshop will broaden participation in the SaTC community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

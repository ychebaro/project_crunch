<AbstractNarration>The development of new pest management approaches is critical for the production of sufficient food for the increasing human population, and for prevention of arthropod-transmitted disease to plants and humans. The more widespread pest distribution associated with changing climatic conditions exacerbates the need for new pest management tools. The economic losses associated with the activities of arthropods and nematodes are a significant burden to society through both agricultural losses and human health costs. The Center for Arthropod Management Technologies (CAMTech) addresses issues that limit effective management of the major insect and nematode pests that impact agriculture and human health. The center addresses the need for specific knowledge and research tools to expedite delivery of pest management solutions by industry partners to the marketplace, and to investigate both new approaches, and expansion of existing approaches for pest suppression. The major limitations in the field are common to the agricultural biotechnology and urban pest management industries and restrict widespread adoption of strategies shown to be effective in some systems. The center contributes key advances through state of the art, industrially relevant research and by training of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers including underrepresented groups, toward continued advancement of the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAMTech serves as a platform for innovative, interdisciplinary research activities at the interface of academia, government, and industry. Expertise in entomology and other departments at the University of Kentucky include insect physiology, genomics, population genetics, vector biology, and symbiosis.  The research needs of industries in the agricultural biotechnology and human health domains align well with the expertise of university participants providing for the expedited development of pest management solutions to the benefit of agricultural sustainability and public wellbeing. Advanced methods including next-generation sequencing and -omics, confocal microscopy, RNA interference and genome editing are employed to conduct non-competitive research of crucial importance to the industrial sector. The research products are transferred to member companies through quarterly reports and presentations at bi-annual IAB meetings and to the public in the form of publications and presentations at conferences. Fundamental knowledge gained from center research on mechanisms of RNA interference, insecticide resistance, toxicological effects of insecticides, physiological processes of pests and disease vectors facilitate R&amp;D efforts of industry and expedite the development of new products for pest and disease vector control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

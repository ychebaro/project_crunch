<AbstractNarration>This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. Professor Jose Juncosa from Salisbury University and colleague Seth Friese have upgraded the console of a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer and equipped the resulting spectrometer with an automatic changer that allows students to collect data on multiple samples. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The instrument positively impacts student researchers who coauthor papers and present their results at local and national conferences. The spectrometer promotes enhanced research opportunities in its outreach, and empowers future generations in science and engineering. The NMR spectrometer has a direct impact on the quality and productivity of research and research training activities in the broader geographic region, particularly the lower Eastern Shore of the Delmarva Peninsula. The spectrometer is shared with researchers at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, a neighboring Historically Black College and University (HBCU).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It especially aids in the characterization of synthetic agonists for the serotonin receptor denominated 5-HT-24 and the design of  new nitrogen-containing donor ligands. The spectrometer is used to characterize alkaloids synthesized using oxazolium salt transformations and to identify genes and enzymes. The instrument helps researchers developing switchable magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents used in conjunction with MRI scanning devices and for the analysis of synthetic 2-oxopyrroline enaminone hybrid analogues. The NMR spectrometer is also utilized on the search for bioactive microbial natural products and for hybrid antioxidants/muscarinic agonists which are agents that activates the activity of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor in cell membranes of certain neurons and other cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>This project will develop novel methods for analyzing and modeling &lt;br/&gt;heterogeneous dynamic networked data. Network data arises in a number of &lt;br/&gt;application domains ranging from Internet of Things, cloud computing, software analysis, &lt;br/&gt;neuroscience, biology, geography, to social sciences. Accordingly, network &lt;br/&gt;analysis has emerged as a major paradigm for exploring complex processes &lt;br/&gt;behind observed data. Compared to high dimensional data, analysis of network &lt;br/&gt;data is more challenging due to interdependencies between entities, the &lt;br/&gt;presence of attributes, and the natural evolution of networks over time. The &lt;br/&gt;goal of the project will be to understand and model the heterogeneity of &lt;br/&gt;behaviors in dynamic networks. The project will have a transformative impact &lt;br/&gt;on big data problems that are enabled by a network-centric approach to &lt;br/&gt;exploiting dynamic, heterogeneous data, such as brain networks. The project &lt;br/&gt;will integrate research and education by introducing methods and results of the &lt;br/&gt;project into courses and seminars, and train a diverse group of undergraduate &lt;br/&gt;and graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's focus will be on heterogeneity in dynamic networks: &lt;br/&gt;heterogeneity of node behaviors across network structure and time, &lt;br/&gt;heterogeneity of the coupling of structure and attributes, and heterogeneity &lt;br/&gt;across networks. Against this backdrop, the project will consider the basic &lt;br/&gt;problems of clustering (partitioning), classification/regression, decomposition &lt;br/&gt;of networks into its basis elements, and the problem of explaining global &lt;br/&gt;network behaviors by small network fragments. These problems will be &lt;br/&gt;considered for a single network and for multiple networks. Within a network, &lt;br/&gt;heterogeneity is observed when nodes or clusters exhibit different behaviors, &lt;br/&gt;for instance due to hidden or missing data. Across networks, heterogeneity is &lt;br/&gt;observed in the diversity of subject populations or among network instances. &lt;br/&gt;The first research thrust will apply spectral theory for partitioning attributed &lt;br/&gt;and dynamic networks. The second research thrust will apply convex &lt;br/&gt;optimization to find clusters while tolerating heterogeneity across network &lt;br/&gt;structure and time. It will also develop methods for estimating graphical models &lt;br/&gt;for multiple dynamic networks. The final research thrust will focus on the &lt;br/&gt;discovery of succinct sub-networks that are predictive and that evolve &lt;br/&gt;concurrently with the underlying networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

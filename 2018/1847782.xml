<AbstractNarration>Non-technical description: Quantum phenomena promise to reshape the technological landscape over the coming decades. A drastic improvement in computing power is expected when quantum computers become reality, but this may also present new security risks as quantum computers can break conventional encryption schemes with ease. Quantum cryptography offers a solution by providing unbreakable encryption through the utilization of entangled photon pairs. However, the lack of efficient methods to produce entangled photons, along with a strong demand for workforce fluent in quantum science, are significant challenges. The main objective of this NSF CAREER research is to develop a new method for entangled photon production based on two-dimensional materials. By exploring the new physics present at the two-dimensional superconductor-semiconductor interfaces, the principal investigator lays the foundation for entangled photon production by Cooper pair injection. The educational objective of this CAREER proposal is to improve the curricula at George Mason University to prepare students for entering the growing quantum workforce. The principal investigator works with local communities to create a transdisciplinary team focusing on quantum materials, to build an active and vibrant community of materials scientists through public engagements, and to inspire underrepresented K-12 youth to pursue a career in the quantum sciences through outreach activities. These efforts take advantage of existing outreach programs at George Mason University as well as the principal investigator's newly founded Quantum Materials Center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical description: The principal investigator endeavors to build a strong research program at George Mason University focused on understanding quantum phenomena in two-dimensional materials. The research objective of this NSF CAREER project is to explore proximity effects in two-dimensional materials with a focus on the superconductor-semiconductor interface. The ultimate goal of this research is to develop new pathways for a high-purity, on-demand entangled photon source for quantum information technology. The research approach relies on the assembly and characterization of van der Waals heterostructures. The principal investigator uses optical, magnetic, and electronic characterization techniques to study the properties of these heterostructures with a variety of different stacking arrangements between tungsten diselenide and niobium diselenide. The envisioned outcomes of this research project are: 1) a new understanding of the interaction between Cooper-pairs and excitons using magneto-optical spectroscopy, 2) fabrication and exploration of superconducting light-emitting diodes based on van der Waals heterostructures, and 3) production of entangled photons from an atomically-thin superconducting light-emitting diode. The principal investigator's studies take advantage of the unique facilities developed in his laboratory and the strong relationships with researchers at nearby national laboratories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

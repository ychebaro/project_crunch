<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is that it benefits automotive OEM, battery recycling, consumer electronics, energy storage, and battery manufacturing industry. The proposed innovation will enable a reduction in the cost of new Li-ion batteries by 25%. The proposed innovation minimizes the use of raw materials from mining, enables the long-term material availability, stabilizes the supply chain, and reduces the life-cycle cost. Additionally, recycling Li-ion batteries using the proposed innovation generates zero secondary wastes and thus minimizes environmental footprint. From the I-Corps curriculum training, if a clear go decision is made, this project will lead to an establishment of a new company that creates jobs, opens new business opportunities, and benefits both the environment and society. The success of this I-Corps project will accelerate technology commercialization and attract third-party funding.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project explores market needs of this non-destructive separation technology for waste Li-ion batteries. The team proposes to conduct at least 100 face-to-face interviews with potential customers to obtain first-hand evidence to validate business model, determines the supply chain of Li-ion battery manufacturing industry and recycling industry, and define customer segments and corresponding value propositions. The proposed technology separates and recovers valuable materials while preserving their original functional integrity. The upcycled active battery materials can be reused in new Li-ion batteries. The proposed solution is much more energy efficient and cost effective compared to the existing processes, for which both processes involve a conversion of active cathode materials to metal alloys or metal ions in solution. The proposed innovation works for any types of Li-ion batteries. The proposed innovation does not generate secondary wastes. This project will train one graduate student as an entrepreneur. The EL will gain hands-on experience of conducting customer discovery and developing a business model canvas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>Contrary to popular notion, the fastest movements in biology are not exhibited by large, multicellular animals such as a sprinting cheetahs or Usain Bolt, but by obscure, tiny microscopic single cell organisms. How a seemingly simple cell may generate extraordinary power and speed, without muscles, remains an open question. To address this critical knowledge gap, this project will study an extreme unicellular organism (Spirostomum ambiguum) that harnesses poorly understood molecular motors, springs and latches to achieve some of the fastest and most powerful movements in nature. In addition to advancing our knowledge of cell biology, insights from this project holds potential for a breakthrough in nanoscale engineering, including design of powerful micro-robots. The PI will involve young scientists across all levels in cell biophysics research including K-12, undergraduate and under-represented minority students in the Atlanta area. The PI will also host high-school summer interns in partnership with Lambert High School. Research findings and scientific discoveries will be shared with the broader public through popular media outlets including, popular media, YouTube, and the local Atlanta Science Festival. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spirostomum is a relatively large protozoan, which moves via a controllable-triggered myoneme.  It is an excellent model system to understand fundamental questions of achieving extraordinary power amplification at the scale of a single cell. The proposed research will integrate tools and techniques from biology, physics and mathematics to develop a multi-scale framework that establishes: i) the governing principles for force generation through calcium-based supramolecular protein networks (i.e., myonemes); ii) the physical limits on speed imposed by both cellular material properties and viscous energetic dissipation to environment; and iii), collective hydrodynamic communication and sensing through ultra fast group contractions in single cells.&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Physics of Living Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

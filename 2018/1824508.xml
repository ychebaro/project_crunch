<AbstractNarration>Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) proposes to support technical services on R/V Atlantis, a 274? general purpose research vessel and R/V Armstrong, a new 238? multidisciplinary vessel. Both vessels are owned by the Navy and are operated by WHOI as part of the U.S. Academic Fleet which is scheduled by the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As part of their basic operations WHOI will provide two technicians on each seagoing research project, and will maintain, calibrate and provide for qualified users items from their pool of shared-use research instrumentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHOI also proposes to provide several elements of specialized support for investigators, with separate charges. Specialized support requested for 2018 includes:&lt;br/&gt;1) Support for Sea Education Association (SEA) &lt;br/&gt;2) SATNAG &lt;br/&gt;3) MISO&lt;br/&gt;4) PFPE/Gravimeter&lt;br/&gt;5) Sensor Calibration&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts       &lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>Low frequency radio arrays are opening up a new window in discovery space.  Designed to maximize throughput, they have the survey speed and sensitivity to find a significant number of sources absent in earlier studies. They can systematically probe the radio sky for transient and variable sources, following up exotic transients while characterizing the behavior of known sources. The Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) and the Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) are premier facilities well suited for detecting radio emissions occurring on sub-second timescales using unique detection strategies to overcome noisy environments. Detected transients will trigger mapping to image the source of emission to locate and determine the emission mechanisms giving rise to it.   Some will be known sources with unexplained energetics while others will be totally new sources.  This grant funds a postdoctoral associate and undergraduate students at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, who will gain valuable Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education in signal processing and analyzing massive amounts of data, which is a necessary skill in today?s software industry. The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee?s Astronomy Club will expand its STEM activities by involving undergraduate students in this research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will use the abilities of the MWA?s and ASKAP?s as discovery engines to detect short duration, less than one second, transient events and variable phenomena in imaging surveys over the sky. Together MWA and ASKAP provide powerful and complementary constraints on source?s astrophysics by providing data over an octave in radio frequency.  It will focus on the study of the emission mechanisms of low mass stars and extrasolar planets, orphan gamma-ray burst afterglows, multi-wavelength to multi-messenger prompt and coherent emission with MWA and late time after glows with ASKAP, as well as unexpected sources/transients from unknown progenitors. Detection strategies to overcome background emission will include circular polarization detection and image subtraction against background radiation.  The discovery of significant events will be followed-up by measurements at multiple wavelengths.  If nothing is discovered, significant limits will be established for future searches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

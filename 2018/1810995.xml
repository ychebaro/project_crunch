<AbstractNarration>The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the STEM workforce through the development of highly competitive students from groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines:  African-Americans, Alaska Natives, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders.  The goal of the LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Activity is to increase the quantity and quality of STEM graduate students from underrepresented populations, with emphasis on PhD matriculation and completion.  BD programs implemented in the nation's institutions of higher education contribute to addressing one of the objectives in NSF's 2018-2022 Strategic Plan, namely, to foster the growth of a more capable and diverse research workforce and advance the scientific and innovation skills of the Nation.  The vision of this grant is to provide a national model to produce underrepresented scientists and engineers with doctoral degrees in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Texas A&amp;M Engineering Experiment Station will be the host site for the 2018-2020 Texas A&amp;M University System Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (TAMUS LSAMP) Bridge to the Doctorate Program.  Twelve first-time graduate students from groups historically underrepresented in STEM will be selected as BD Fellows.  The Fellows will be nurtured for two years as a cohort community benefiting from a program of academic and personal development activities and social support, to sustain their commitment and success to their degree programs and advancement toward doctoral programs by the end of their second year.  The BD students, with differing STEM disciplines and a common purpose, will share coordinated resources and intellectually enriching group activities with each other, and with the larger population of STEM, minority and other graduate students at Texas A&amp;M, to the benefit of all.  The TAMUS LSAMP BD project at Texas A&amp;M will enhance the infrastructure of research and education by advancing pursuit of graduate and doctoral STEM degrees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

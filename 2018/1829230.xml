<AbstractNarration>This project, from the University of Alabama (UA), extends their initial I-Corps Site award for scale up to their next phase of support for innovation and entrepreneurship. Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors. This is a Type II I-Corps Site project. Type II proposals are submitted by institutions that have already received a Type I award.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this I-Corps Type II Site is to build on, extend and expand the local innovation ecosystem, and to nurture STEM faculty and students to transition their ideas into the marketplace so these early stage teams can build sustainable companies, create new jobs, attract investment, and benefit society. Boosting the local innovation ecosystem by nurturing STEM faculty and students propelled the University of Alabama Site into a formal, active, local innovation ecosystem contributing to the national network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors. The UA Site provides infrastructure, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or become I-Corps Team applicants. In 2016 the US Site became partners with the  regional I-Corps Node, I-Corps South, at the Georgia Institute of Technology. The UA Site, which has been successful in activities that increase inclusiveness, will also continue to improve and expand Lean Launchpad curriculum and training programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

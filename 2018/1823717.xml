<AbstractNarration>Thermokarst lakes that form when permafrost thaws and subsides are common features in Arctic regions. Recently, these lakes have been identified as providing a key pathway for methane release to the atmosphere. However, quantifying these fluxes has remained elusive. The purpose of this project is to connect direct observations of lake methane gas emissions, local geophysical mapping of these emissions, and regional-scale satellite-based observations, to improve the quantification and scaling of methane gas release from Arctic thaw lakes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rapid and non-invasive ground-based geophysical measurements will be taken to describe thermokarst lake methane emissions, develop relationships between lake expansion and methane emissions, and then use Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery to scale the results to large regions. The synergy of direct, geophysical, and remote sensing measurements will provide linked, multi- scale observations not previously available. The outcomes of this work have implications for understanding global carbon budgets, Arctic engineering, and the development of environmental monitoring methods. Furthermore, this research will provide additional validation to the Ground Penetrating Radar and Synthetic Aperture Radar methods, benefit their respective development fields, and encourage more widespread application of these methods across the Arctic. This project includes outreach efforts to local communities that will result in summaries of the scientific results for general dissemination. Graduate and undergraduate students will be mentored throughout the research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaborations recently announced the first observation of gravitational waves from merging neutron stars. The first gravitational-wave constraints on neutron-star matter have begun to shine new light on the properties of matter above nuclear density, cross-checking neutron-star measurements in electromagnetic astronomy and informing calculations in nuclear physics. Upgrades to the detectors are in progress, and we are soon to enter an era in which regular observations can used to learn about astrophysical sources. These first constraints will be supplanted by precision measurements that rely on an accurate understanding of how neutron star matter affects gravitational waves. In the proposed work, the CSUF students will explore the impact of dense matter on gravitational waves. This research introduces them to the science community, sparking future participation in gravitational astrophysics, data science, and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CSUF group will develop on-the-fly hybrid waveform infrastructure within LIGO software, connecting expensive numerical mergers to long analytic inspirals with desired parameters, yielding waveforms spanning LIGO's entire frequency band and quantifying accuracy requirements. They will determine and work to reduce the systematic errors in gravitational-wave parameter estimation techniques using multiple neutron-star waveform models and simulations. These efforts will connect the information coming from gravitational-wave observations with the broader astrophysical context of dense neutron-star matter and microphysics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

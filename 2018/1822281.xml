<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps is a novel noninvasive ventilation modality for treatment of mild and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients.  Two million Americans have such severe COPD that, even on maximal medical therapy, they are unable to walk up a single flight of stairs due to severe shortness of breath. As the disease progresses, patients become bound to their house, their chair, and finally their bed. This technology provides a non-intrusive pulmonary support to patients in a form of a lightweight, mobile, and noninvasive ventilator, which can help support these patients during physical activity and help them live a full life again, free of suffocation. Long term impacts of this technology include: (1) increased quality of life and treatment effectiveness for severe COPD patients; (2) development of novel pulmonary rehabilitation therapies; (3) expansion of noninvasive ventilation technology in the field of pulmonary care to supplement and enhance current ventilation techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is a mobile, non-invasive ventilation technology targeted at COPD patients. The device works by supplementing patient's breathing with pressure changes on their chest and abdomen. With each breath in, the device generates a vacuum that helps lift the chest and abdomen, helping the patient breathe in.  With each breath out, the device increases pressure over the chest and helps the patient breath out faster.  By assisting the work of breathing, patients no longer feel short of breath and can once again engage in normal daily activities. The device promotes a healthy breathing cycle, which prevents hyperinflation of the airways and degeneration of alveoli in the lungs. Noninvasive ventilation and pulmonary rehabilitation have both been shown to have significant, positive effects on the quality of life and medical outcomes of COPD patients. The technology aims to improve patient's well-being.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

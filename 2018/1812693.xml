<AbstractNarration>The interaction and scattering of light by periodic structures at the nanoscale &lt;br/&gt;is a topic of great significance in the area of nanophotonics and metamaterials &lt;br/&gt;technology. With the current rapid development of this enabling technology, there &lt;br/&gt;is a high demand on new mathematical theories and computational algorithms &lt;br/&gt;for both direct and inverse problems of the light scattering by periodic complex &lt;br/&gt;media or periodic metamaterials. This project aims to develop such theories &lt;br/&gt;and algorithms. Results from this project will advance knowledge, understanding &lt;br/&gt;and imaging techniques in the technology of nanophotonics and metamaterials. &lt;br/&gt;For instance, the mathematical theories and the computational algorithms developed &lt;br/&gt;for the direct problems are extremely useful for the simulation, fabrication and &lt;br/&gt;maintaining of optical devices. The imaging techniques developed for the inverse &lt;br/&gt;problems can be potentially of practical use for non-destructive tests, which help &lt;br/&gt;to detect and characterize discrete flaws in optical components and devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project contains two main areas of study: the mathematical and numerical &lt;br/&gt;analysis for direct scattering problems, and the development of efficient inversion &lt;br/&gt;algorithms for inverse scattering problems. More precisely, for the direct problem, &lt;br/&gt;the PI and his colleagues will work on the following topics: 1) develop volume integral &lt;br/&gt;equation formulations for direct scattering problems for periodic complex media; 2) &lt;br/&gt;develop fast integral equation-based numerical solvers for the direct scattering problems; &lt;br/&gt;3) study interior transmission eigenvalues for periodic complex media; 4) study &lt;br/&gt;well-posedness of the scattering by chiral metamaterials. The proposed research &lt;br/&gt;for the inverse problem includes the topics: 1) develop sampling methods &lt;br/&gt;for imaging of periodic complex  media; 2) develop sampling methods for the detection &lt;br/&gt;of local defects in photonic crystals; 3) develop globally convergent methods for &lt;br/&gt;the identification of material parameters for photonic crystals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

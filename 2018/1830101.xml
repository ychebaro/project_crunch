<AbstractNarration>This grant supports student travel for U.S. students to attend the 26th International Requirements Engineering Conference to be held in Banff, Alberta, Canada from August 24th -28th, 2018. This is the flagship conference in this subfield of Software Engineering, where research and practice comes together. The purpose is to advance and grow this field of research. Students will meet senior researchers and colleagues to exchange ideas and collaborate to advance the field. Doctoral students will attend the Doctoral Symposium where they will receive feedback on their research. The grant will contribute to building an a globally aware workforce of scientists and engineers. The field of Requirements Engineering works toward improving the quality of software-intensive systems as well as the productivity of the processes that produce them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>The Future of Privacy Forum Education and Innovation Foundation (FPF EIF) is establishing the Applied Privacy Research Coordination Network (Applied Privacy RCN) to support the transition of academic privacy research to commercial practice by providing ongoing, structured networking and opportunities for privacy scholars to meet industry leaders involved in their research areas and develop working partnerships. The Applied Privacy RCN will promote new knowledge, techniques and practices to better protect individual privacy. Cutting-edge privacy research can lead to cutting-edge commercial applications -- but only if privacy researchers and corporate privacy leaders are connected. This RCN offers targeted mechanisms to bridge the gap between scholarship and industry practice. The RCN will bring researchers together with privacy leaders from the world's top companies and innovators across business sectors, engage the world's largest privacy professional association and top industry trade associations, and expand reach to international audiences and markets. The RCN will accelerate industry action and help transition promising privacy research to real-world practice where personal information is handled in a manner that respects individual privacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To accomplish these goals, the RCN will organize academic participation in and presentations to monthly meetings of FPF industry-specific working groups and direct communications and introductions with FPF EIF's corporate members. It will organize a series of presentations of academic researchers to industry practitioners at the annual in-person meeting of the FPF Advisory Board, the global summit conference of the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP), a new event at the FPF EIF's marquee annual event, Privacy Papers for Policymakers, and at an international workshop designed to build international collaborations of privacy researchers and industry. The events will attract graduate and doctoral student participants, support junior scholar publishing opportunities, and develop internship opportunities. Through its strategies and methods, the RCN furthers the development of a community of privacy researchers and builds the wider field of practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>This award will support attendance by early career researchers at the annual Rust Belt RNA Meetings to be held in Columbus, OH (October 26-27, 2018); in Cleveland, OH (2019); and in Pittsburgh, PA (2020). The topics covered by the meetings include all aspects of RNA biology. The format is a combination of talks and posters, which aims to promote scientific exchange in both formal and informal settings. Additional activities, including workshops and panel discussions, will provide professional development and mentoring opportunities for early-career scientists. There will be ample opportunity for sharing latest research results and for networking. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent years have witnessed breakthroughs in diverse areas of RNA science, including the epi-transcriptome, RNA-mediated regulation, functional characterization of non-coding RNAs and RNA-binding proteins, and genome-wide, multi-disciplinary approaches to decipher the networks that underlie cellular and organismal differentiation and development.  The upcoming meetings will encompass the full scope of these topics and draw regional participation to provide students and senior researchers with opportunities to learn and share RNA-related research.  Attendees will be exposed to new conceptual developments, as well as new tools, including computational, biochemical and biophysical approaches.  The meeting has and will continue to foster collaborations among diverse scientists from institutions of various types and sizes.  A hallmark of the meeting will continue to be strong participation by students at undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral levels. Scholarships and dedicated recruiting efforts will be aimed at encouraging attendance by scientists from underrepresented groups.  This meeting serves to expose students (often for the first time) to the breadth and quality of research seen at national meetings, while preserving a welcoming, informal atmosphere.  These qualities, in combination with the meeting's accessibility and affordability, make it an invaluable asset to the Midwest region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

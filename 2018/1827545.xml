<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this PFI project is to bring a paradigm change in the Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) probe market from a single-channel to multi-channel probe. AFM is one of the most powerful tools to image and characterize materials with nanometer scale resolution, leading to the extensive development of nano-/bio- science and technology. While there has been a significant improvement in all other aspects of AFM components, the AFM probe design has not changed from a simple rectangular or triangular beam over the past 30+ years. The proposed AFM probe can extend its functionality from a single-channel to multi-channel probe such that it can be easily employed in various AFM schemes to characterize multi-physical properties beyond topography. Thus, AFM users can effortlessly implement the advanced multi-functional AFM schemes with minimal ambiguity, complications, and artifacts, by simply employing this new AFM probe. The proposed innovation will forward the market position of the US AFM industry and the industries that rely on AFM utilization. As an unmatched and versatile tool to uncover important fundamentals in many areas of science and technology, the advancement of AFM will lead to further scientific discoveries and new technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project aims to overcome the technical barriers related to manufacturability, reliability, and repeatability in order to accelerate commercialization. The prototype device used for performance demonstration was individually fabricated by modifying a commercially available AFM cantilever with a focused ion beam (FIB) based milling process and transfer-printing assembly technique. In order to transform the new AFM probe technology into a promising commercial reality, we need to address the important technical and commercial hurdles. Therefore, the main objectives of this proposal are (i) development of a batch manufacturing process for the new probe design, (ii) topology optimization of the probe design to guarantee the reliability and performance robustness over the wide range of operating parameters, (iii) demonstration of the functionality of the new probe design in customer settings beyond the PI's laboratory, and (iv) development of commercialization strategy and execution plans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

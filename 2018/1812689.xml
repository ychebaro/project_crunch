<AbstractNarration>We are all familiar with gas temperature: a higher temperature implies&lt;br/&gt;more energetic atoms which we feel as heat.  Gasses at the same&lt;br/&gt;temperature have the same distribution of energies: a&lt;br/&gt;Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.  If we heat some of the gas,&lt;br/&gt;collisions quickly re-establish the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.&lt;br/&gt;In addition, collisions between electrons and ions can excite&lt;br/&gt;electronic states (in a neon sign, for example).  The excitation rates&lt;br/&gt;depend sensitively on the tails of the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.&lt;br/&gt;Astrophysicists use these ideas to infer the temperatures, densities,&lt;br/&gt;and compositions of gases in the cosmos.  Observations of the&lt;br/&gt;intensity and wavelengths of the emitted photons provide information&lt;br/&gt;about the composition and energies of the gas.  However, the gas&lt;br/&gt;density in much of the Universe is extraordinarily low. It is so low&lt;br/&gt;that the heating and cooling times are longer than the equilibration&lt;br/&gt;time for the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.  The discrepancy from the&lt;br/&gt;thermal distribution affects radiative cooling rates and the balance&lt;br/&gt;between ionization and recombination.  This changes our interpretation&lt;br/&gt;of observed spectra.  Spectra are important diagnostic of gas&lt;br/&gt;properties throughout the Universe.  The results of this research will&lt;br/&gt;be an improved understanding of cosmic gas for use by all astronomers.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research projects will provide training for graduate&lt;br/&gt;students in high-performance computing and dynamical systems.  These&lt;br/&gt;skills will translate to wide variety of STEM careers.  The proposed&lt;br/&gt;simulations will generate a number of small-scale analyses suitable&lt;br/&gt;for undergraduate projects.  We will provide both term-time and summer&lt;br/&gt;internships for all institutions in the 5-College Consortium.  This&lt;br/&gt;will help recruit and retain future STEM leaders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These fundamental physical issues motivated a new collisional&lt;br/&gt;Boltzmann equation solver based on Direct Simulation Monte Carlo&lt;br/&gt;(DSMC).  Development of this code motivated new algorithms for&lt;br/&gt;computing the multiple ionization states found in tenuous cosmic&lt;br/&gt;plasma.  The new computational method reproduces the standard LTE&lt;br/&gt;cooling curve. But, it also tracks the non-thermal time-dependent&lt;br/&gt;evolution of gas affected by multiple heating, cooling, and dynamical&lt;br/&gt;processes.  This novel approach promises new insight into the exotic&lt;br/&gt;states of gas in galaxies.  For example, consider the circumgalactic&lt;br/&gt;medium (CGM). Interpreting non-thermal ionization fractions in the&lt;br/&gt;thermal limit may yield the wrong elemental abundances and&lt;br/&gt;unexpectedly large volumes of thermally unstable gas.  Even in the&lt;br/&gt;simple case of a hydrostatic halo, this non-thermal distribution may&lt;br/&gt;pass through multiple CGM gas phases.  This results in an overall&lt;br/&gt;non-thermal mixture of energies and ionization fractions, which&lt;br/&gt;impacts our understanding of gas accretion and wind processes that&lt;br/&gt;govern star formation in galaxies.  The implications are even more&lt;br/&gt;drastic for smaller scale structures like gas clouds embedded in a hot&lt;br/&gt;halo or for shocks.  Overall, these non-thermal distributions affect&lt;br/&gt;absorption and emission features in the optical, UV, and x-ray.  They&lt;br/&gt;alter our interpretation of quasar absorption-line and x-ray spectra.&lt;br/&gt;In short, the proposed work will improve our core understanding of&lt;br/&gt;non-fluid gas dynamics.  This may lead to ground-breaking solutions of&lt;br/&gt;outstanding observational dilemmas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

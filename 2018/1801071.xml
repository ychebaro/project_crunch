<AbstractNarration>Keeping computers and information systems secure is a major challenge. Business, industry, and government need well-prepared technicians who can prevent, detect, and investigate cybersecurity breaches, and the growth of cyber-threats has created a need for many more workers who have the necessary knowledge and skills. To address this nationwide challenge in education and workforce development, this project will establish a cybersecurity program at a tribal college, building a seamless pathway for students to move from high school into an associate degree program in cybersecurity and on to a job or a related bachelor's degree program. The project's overarching goal is to increase the number of students, including Native Americans, veterans, and women, pursuing cybersecurity-focused degrees and technical certifications. The investigators aim to build a replicable model that can be adapted and scaled, especially at other tribal colleges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project at Turtle Mountain Community College will build on the college's Computer Support Specialist program, which provides two years of technical computer education leading to an Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree. Students in the new cybersecurity program will learn skills in computer architecture, operating systems, computer troubleshooting and repair, server administration, network infrastructure design and support, network infrastructure security, and programming. The curriculum will incorporate a hands-on, experiential learning approach. Local employers have committed to provide on-the-job training, job shadowing, and part-time or full-time positions for students. Minot State University's Business Information Technology department will provide professional development for Turtle Mountain Community College faculty, will assist them with developing courses in different formats (on-campus, online, and hybrid), and will support a pathway for students who wish to transfer to the university after completing the two-year degree. The key activities in the project are (1) to develop a new AAS degree in cybersecurity/information assurance that is aligned with the needs of local business and industry; (2) to recruit high school students on or near the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation into the program through summer camps and other outreach; (3) to encourage students to obtain industry-recognized certifications to validate the skills they learn in the degree program; (4) to utilize connections within the Northern Information Technology Consortium (including Dakota College at Bottineau, Lake Region State College, Minot State University, and Williston State College) to extend the reach of the curriculum and support students who would like to transition to a related four-year degree program; and (5) to provide workshops, seminars, and other professional development activities to improve the cybersecurity knowledge and skills of Turtle Mountain Community College faculty.  This project will contribute to national priorities by strengthening cybersecurity education and increasing the diversity of the cybersecurity technical workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>An explosion of low-cost wireless devices promises new applications and services in diverse domains, including health, transportation, energy, manufacturing, and entertainment. This project focuses on developing energy and spectrum-efficient, distributed multi-access strategies for dynamic and large-scale wireless networks under the stringent energy and delay requirements that are expected in emerging applications. This work will enable the development of a multitude of technologies that can improve the life of society-at-large. For example, this work can support the next generation of communication technologies for large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) applications and autonomous vehicle applications. Moreover, education is a core component of this project. New theories and algorithms developed in this project are integrated into the graduate-level courses at the three universities. Undergraduate and graduate students are involved in the project through the undergrad capstone and masters graduation projects at the Ohio State University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project explores the fundamental energy and spectrum-efficiency tradeoff of distributed spectrum access methods, and develops adaptive and correlated strategies that embrace and control randomness with efficiency guarantees for dynamic users with delay-sensitive traffic. In addition, the design incorporates humans into the loop by observing how humans react in simple multi-access games, providing simple human behavior models and simple human-perceived quality metrics, and by designing methods that can adapt to unexpected events or actions. A combined analysis and implementation approach of this project exploits high-dimensionality in the system while also overcoming difficulties for large-scale implementation and testing. In particular, the project develops mean-field techniques and analyses for large-scale spectrum access. Novel real-world experimentation strategies developed in this project emulate large-scale system operation in a small testbed by utilizing the simplification due to our randomized solutions and the integration of the aforementioned mean-field methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

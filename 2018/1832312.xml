<AbstractNarration>This project supports the organization of the second NSF Expeditions in Computing (Expeditions) Principal Investigators' (PI) Meeting at the Newseum's Knight Conference Center in Washington, DC, between Sunday, December 9 and Tuesday, December 11, 2018. The 2018 Expeditions PI Meeting builds on the previous Expeditions PI Meeting and Expeditions research by fostering collaboration and promoting close interaction between academia and industry, governments, research labs, etc. The meeting is a unique opportunity to interact with a broad cross-section of the scientific community, CISE leadership, as well as with leaders in both industry and academia. It also provides an important venue for scanning horizons activities, establishing new collaborations between different collaborating teams, and exploring possible technology transfer and partnerships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These meetings are designed to advance knowledge by exposing the progress of compelling and transformative collaborative research conducted by multi-institutional and multi-disciplinary research teams that promise disruptive innovations in computer and information science and engineering, to allow PIs to showcase their research, and to provide an opportunity to network. The 2018 Expeditions PI Meeting will bring together approximately 150 stakeholders comprising academia, industry, and government. The Expeditions PI Meeting 2018 will take place on the 10th year anniversary of the Expeditions program launch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

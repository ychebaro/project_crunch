<AbstractNarration>This grant supports acquisition of an Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) to support a new collaborative Geochemistry Research Group, consisting of new and senior faculty in the Department of Geological and Environmental Sciences at California State University, Chico, a Hispanic Serving Institution.  The instrument will support trace element analyses that will facilitate cross-disciplinary research related to the geochemistry of the Earth by faculty, undergraduates and M.S. students.  Access to an on-campus ICP-MS will facilitate undergraduate research in geochemistry by providing students with hands-on analytical experience.  The investigators have significant combined experience mentoring non-traditional, underrepresented undergraduate independent STEM research projects, from initial development through presentation at regional or national meetings and publications. The ICP-MS will be incorporated into over 20 classes in the College of Natural Sciences and the College of Agriculture, giving a wide range of student users state-of-the-art analytical experience. In association with the Gateway Science Museum, the Geochemistry Research Group will set up a Citizen Science project to assess water quality in the Chico area.  This support is congruent with NSFs mission of promoting the progress of science and advancing the national health, prosperity and welfare given the societal relevance of targeted environmental research aimed at understanding the terrestrial water cycle with implications for improved water resource management and the impact of the acquisition on training the next generation scientific workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ICP-MS will support NSF-funded projects in geochemistry and other current collaborations of the research group but, more importantly, it will enable new multidisciplinary collaborations in three main foci: Aqueous Biogeochemistry, Geochemistry of Ore Deposits and Mine Reclamation; and Petrology. The research group is currently engaged in a variety of research including: the role of iron in biogeochemical cycling, mediating urban storm-water runoff by biofiltration, mineralization of Gold (Au) bearing deposits, assessing soil and water contamination from historic mining, metasomatism of stromatolites, and the petrogenetic evolution of a chain of basaltic volcanoes.  New projects in development include studies of surface water quality in Lassen Volcanic National Park (California), impacts of volcanic fluids and gases on surrounding soils and vegetation, and petrology of the largest eruptive unit (the Lovejoy Basalt) identified in California.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

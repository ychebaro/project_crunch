<AbstractNarration>This award provides funds for the CORES study which will help NSF's Division of Earth Sciences (EAR) set priorities and strategies for its investments in research, infrastructure and training in the coming decade.  Within the past decade, breakthroughs and discoveries in Earth science have transformed our understanding of our planet and allowed researchers to investigate, model, and predict a range of Earth phenomena that range in scale from atomic to planetary, and over milliseconds to millennia.  The Earth sciences are among the most integrative of sciences, incorporating physical, chemical, biological and social science approaches to understand the dynamics and processes of our planet, and address the challenges faced by its inhabitants. Because the Earth sciences examines processes that support and affect organisms and life and have direct feedbacks with humans and their evolution, Earth science research has direct societal, economic, security and environmental impacts.  This decadal survey will help NSF's Division of Earth Sciences to identify research areas that are poised for significant advance in the near term, and set relevant priorities and strategies for its investments, with expert advice provided by the National Academies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CORES study will be completed by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) Division of Earth and Life Studies' Board on Earth Sciences and Resources (BESR) and the Water Science and Technology Board for the NSF Division of Earth Sciences (EAR).  The National Academies will assemble an ad hoc committee of volunteer experts from the Earth sciences research community.  The committee will prepare a community-based, consensus study that will include: a concise set of high-priority scientific questions that will advance the Earth sciences over the coming decade, an analysis of the portfolio of EAR's research infrastructure investments, and a discussion of how EAR can leverage and complement the capabilities, expertise and strategic plans of its partners, encourage greater collaboration and maximize shared use of research assets and data. The peer-reviewed report will be shared and disseminated publicly with a targeted audience of the research and technical community, policy and decision makers, and others with an interest in Earth science and policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

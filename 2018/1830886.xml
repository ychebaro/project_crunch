<AbstractNarration>Light is an electromagnetic wave that has both electric and magnetic components. However, when light interacts with matter typically only its electric component is able to interact. This project is focused on the study of light emitted by so-called rare earth ions, which are unique in their ability to interact with both the electric and magnetic components of the light. Such "double interaction" enables additional controls over light in these materials. In particular, the investigators study interaction of both the electric and magnetic components of light with a variety of nanopatterned optical materials. This helps one to obtain knowledge leading to the development of microscopes with higher resolution, advanced biological and chemical sensors, and ultrafast electronic chips and circuits. The Broader Impacts of the project include strengthening of the graduate program in Materials Science and Engineering in one of the nation's largest historically black university. The project enriches education and training of graduate and undergraduate students from underrepresented minority groups by involving them in cutting-edge research activities. Outreach visits to local high schools with high minority enrollment are designed to promote the value of education in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strong modification of optical electric and magnetic fields in close vicinity of plasmonic nanostructures provides multiple opportunities for fundamental studies and applications. While the effects associated with electric field enhancement are the subject of numerous studies, the effects and opportunities related to modifications in optical magnetic fields remain largely unexplored. The main goals of the project are (i) better understanding of the fundamental properties of optical magnetic dipoles in nanostructured engineered environments, and (ii) development of approaches for control and enhancement of magnetic dipole emission with modified optical environments. In the course of the project, the investigators synthesize organic systems with rare earth ions having magnetic dipole transitions in the optical range, and explore their optical behavior in various local optical environments, including resonant nanostructures. The project is also aimed at new characterization methods allowing one to probe and map optical electric and magnetic fields at the nanoscale, which is important for further development of optical nano sources and metamaterials. In addition, luminescent organic systems with rare earth metal ions developed in the course of the project are of interest for various fundamental and applied studies in nanophotonics and optoelectronics. On the other hand, the project expands the research capabilities and enhances the Materials Science and Engineering graduate program at Norfolk State University, one of the largest HBCUs in the nation. This research enriches education and training of graduate and undergraduate students from underrepresented minority groups and promotes STEM education in local high schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>The researchers intend to drill two 165-meter long cores to bedrock from the col (i.e., the lowest point on a mountain ridge between two peaks) at 6,050 meters above sea level masl) and two 70-meter cores from the South Peak summit at 6,756 masl). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the col was surveyed and successfully drilled to bedrock in 1993, summit drilling was not possible, and only a few dating techniques were available to help establish a valid time scale for the last 20,000 years. Stable isotope records from Huascaran will provide histories of mid-troposphere temperature and precipitation, and the site's proximity to the Amazon Basin will allow the reconstruction of environmental changes in the vast rainforest by analyzing biological parameters (microbial populations, pollen and methane concentrations).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers aim to address the following objectives: (1) document and characterize abrupt climate and environmental variations with emphasis on mid-Holocene events and the deglaciation; (2) assess how the climate and environment have changed over the past century in response to anthropogenic forcing; (3) establish tightly constrained timescales for each of the ice cores; (4) determine tropical atmospheric and climatological dynamics on multi-decadal, decadal, and ENSO time scales; (5) assess the regional characteristics of climatic and environmental variability during the Holocene and Last Glacial Stage (LGS) with a focus on changes in the Amazon Basin and determine how they compare to contemporaneous conditions elsewhere; and (6) provide one-quarter of the Huascaran col core for archival at the U.S. National Ice Core Laboratory for future investigations by the scientific community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential Broader Impacts (B.I.) includes strong science and educational aspects.  Mid-tropospheric warming in the Peruvian Andes, enhanced by recent strong El Ninos, is accelerating glacier retreat. Currently this retreat is increasing dry season water discharge which is not sustainable.  Most of Peru's population lives in the west coast desert which relies on glacier streams for agriculture, hydroelectricity, and municipal water supplies. Retreating glaciers also exacerbate geohazards and impact ecosystems, tourism and recreation. Understanding the impact of this acceleration of glacier loss on future water resources requires information about past changes in high elevation glacier mass balance which is virtually unknown, except from a few point-estimates based on ice core studies.  Such information is urgently needed by policymakers, governmental agencies, and public resource administrators to help guide mitigation and adaptation strategies. Educational and public outreach will be conducted through Ohio State University's Education and Outreach Program recently established educational and outreach programs in Peru. Such programs are dedicated to providing climatic and environmental information to students, the public, and policymakers at all levels.  The project would support early career scientists and continue to foster international collaborations in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

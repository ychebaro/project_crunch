<AbstractNarration>Faculty from five different institutions will organize and manage a workshop for undergraduates that will provide an opportunity to learn how to conduct meteorological research in Greenland. Students who participate in this experience will learn how to make measurements of energy fluxes and upper air radiosonde measurements at or near the Greenland ice sheet. They will also learn about the history of weather and climate measurements in Greenland and get the opportunity to share cultures with faculty and college students from Greenland. The workshop will be held in Kangerlussuaq, Greenland and potentially include training at Summit Station, high (11,000 ft.) on the Greenland Ice Sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Applications for participation in the workshop will be available in early 2019. Selection of the workshop attendees will be made by a committee of faculty from five different institutions, including the University of Michigan, Virginia Tech University, Hampton University, Pennsylvania State University College Park and the University of Albany. Students who attend the workshop will benefit from an exceptional experiential learning opportunity for undergraduates. The group will include students and faculty from Greenland, providing an opportunity for international collaborations. The workshop contributes to NSF's Strategic Objective 2.2 "STEM Workforce: Foster the growth of a more capable and diverse research workforce and advance the scientific and innovation skills of the Nation." (NSF Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2018-2022)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

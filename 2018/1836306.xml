<AbstractNarration>This award is to assist US-based graduate students to attend the 2018 ACS/IEEE International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications (ACS/IEEE AICCSA)) to be held in Aqaba, Jordan, October 28 - November 1, 2018.  Participation in AICCSA and similar conferences are valuable and important activities of the graduate school experience. It provides a venue that may expand the experiences of the participating graduate students to enable interactions with researchers in general from all over the world and from the Middle East in particular.  This may have an important impact on their career development and will give some experiences to participate effectively in the global economy and information services.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference held in Aqaba, Jordan will span five days and will consist of technical paper presentations, industry participation, posters, a Doctoral Symposium and a Career Mentoring session.  It will also feature keynote speeches from leading researchers and practitioners.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Student travel to conferences is an important activity. Funds will be dispersed with preference given to students who would not otherwise be able to attend the conference and students who are not already scheduled to present a paper, paying particular attention to provide opportunities to under-represented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

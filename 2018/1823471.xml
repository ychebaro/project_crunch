<AbstractNarration>This grant supports student travel for select students participating in the Doctoral Mentoring Consortium (DMC) at the International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS 2018), to be held in Delft, The Netherlands, June 2018. This is the premier international conference for researchers in automated planning and scheduling research and applications across a fully international research community. This activity will bring together a broad community of researchers in the field of AI, and support junior researchers at this critical early-career stage. These events combine to provide educational opportunities for students and experienced researchers alike, and are extremely popular among conference participants. ICAPS is the major international conference that will figure prominently in the research careers of students who remain involved in planning and scheduling. Students will gain valuable research insights from the exchange of technical ideas in this broader venue. In the process, they are likely to make valuable connections with potential collaborators from around the world. As intelligent software and embodies systems become more prevalent, it is clear that advances in planning and scheduling will have significant impact in virtually any domain imaginable, including transportation, logistics, robotics, and remote sensing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

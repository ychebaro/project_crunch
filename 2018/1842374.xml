<AbstractNarration>This project is funded by STEM + C which supports research and the development of interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches to the integration of computing within STEM teaching and learning for preK-12 students in both formal and informal settings. While computing has dramatically transformed science research and practice, it remains a separate and distinct area of study in almost all pre-college education contexts. The objective of this STEM+C project is to increase students' skill in Computational Thinking - Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (CT-STEM) practices and explore how computational representations support significant shifts in the ways students learn and practice science. Findings will include fine-grained characterizations of the competencies students bring to their development of computational thinking practices, in particular competencies for developing algorithms, data mining and visualization, and designing/building agent-based models (models with multiple software simulated agents that interact). These findings will enrich the field's understanding of the nature and development of CT-STEM practices. This is an important contribution given that investigating CT-STEM practices is still in early stages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the researchers will integrate agent-based modeling software (NetLogo Web) with a block-based form of the software (NetTango) and create seamless interoperation with data analysis, systems dynamics modeling and visualization tools. One benefit of tools like these is that they enable students who do not have experiences with text-based programming to engage in previously inaccessible computational practices. The research team will partner with teachers from three Chicago-area high schools to add Computational Thinking components to existing science curricula by integrating these additional tools and practices. The project will pursue the following five objectives: (1) fully integrate NetLogo and NetTango, create seamless interoperation with data analysis, visualization and systems dynamics modeling tools, and offer the integrated software through the web-based platform; (2) build units that cover more of the high school science curriculum and incorporate practices for developing algorithms, data mining, visualization, and designing/building computational models; (3) develop assessments that evaluate students on these practices; (4) test units and assessments in classrooms by collecting student response data through the web-based platform; and (5) investigate students' engagement in computational thinking practices and characterize the competencies that they bring to their learning and how their practices develop over time. Further, the researchers' online delivery platform will be scalable to facilitate participation from other high schools, potentially engaging many thousands more students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

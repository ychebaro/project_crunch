<AbstractNarration>This research is based upon a science plan to develop an Incoherent Scatter Radar (ISR) data analysis approach that would be applied to high latitude Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar (PFISR) and Resolute bay Incoherent Scatter Radar (RISR) radar measurements resulting in high spatio-temporal measurements of densities, temperatures, and velocities and the associated electrodynamic and energy quantities. The resolution for these data products would be of a finer resolution than that available from current global simulations (sub-grid). The foremost aim of the award research is to contribute to and enhance the understanding of small-scale structures that are associated with the Magnetosphere Ionosphere Thermosphere (MIT) coupling and energy transfer processes. The researchers would combine these radar measurements with in-situ satellite measurements of ion drifts and auroral images to address two fundamental science objectives: 1) the role of ionospheric structuring mechanisms (e.g. ionization, chemistry, diffusion) in various high latitude regions (polar cap, cusp, auroral zone) and 2) the factors impacting energy dissipation including plasma density structuring, free energy sources, and data quality. A graduate student would be supported for this research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigation would address five specific questions: 1), How do impact ionization, transport, diffusion, and chemistry, work in concert to structure the high latitude ionosphere and, hence, conductivity?  2) How does the relative importance of structuring mechanisms vary between the polar cap, cusp, auroral zone, and the boundaries between these regions?  3) How do variations in conductivity, driven through M-I coupling, affect the form, rate, and partitioning of energy dissipation over regional scales?  4) How are experimental results impacted by resolution, registration, and statistical uncertainties in the derived parameter fields? 5) How does the source of free energy (e.g., substorm versus steady reconnection versus high-lat reconnection versus cusp) impact energy dissipation?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

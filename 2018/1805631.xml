<AbstractNarration>Anaerobic membrane bioreactors (AnMBRs) can be used as a low-energy approach to wastewater treatment to produce renewable energy and high-quality water for reuse. However, these bioreactors are limited by membrane fouling caused in part by the attachment of bacteria in wastewater that leads to formation of biofilms at the membrane surface. This fouling accounts for 50% of the AnMBR energy use. The goal of this project is to discover and characterize the key bacteria that initiate biofilm formation on AnMBR membrane surfaces, learn how these bacteria modify the membrane during the fouling process, and identify the physical characteristics of the membrane that make it prone to biofouling. The knowledge gained from these studies will inform the design of improved membranes and membrane treatment strategies that will progress AnMBRs toward economical and sustainable use in wastewater treatment facilities, agro-based industries, and confined animal feeding operations. The project will use the Kansas Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation and the Developing Scholars Program to recruit and retain minority students from rural community colleges in Kansas for summer and year-long internships at Kansas State University, preparing them for careers in sustainable environmental research and technology. If successful, this project will help advance water treatment technologies to protect the Nation's water supply and energy security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to discover microorganisms that initiate biofouling on membranes in anaerobic membrane bioreactors (AnMBRs) and to characterize their molecular fouling strategies. While much effort has focused on developing chemical and physical treatment methods to alleviate biofouling, a poor understanding of the fundamental mechanisms that drive biofilm formation limit long-term strategies to mitigate fouling over these membrane surfaces. The central hypothesis is that early-stage biofouling is driven by a sub-group of AnMBR community members that locally modify the membrane surface through secretion of exopolysaccharides and soluble microbial products. To test this hypothesis, the use of a novel, non-destructive method that uses biocompatible polymeric materials to remove live cells from the membrane surface, termed polymer surface dissection (PSD), will be investigated. The PSD method will enable precise sectioning of early colonizers from the membrane surface in a spatially controlled manner for cell cultivation and microbial identification. This will be coupled with physicochemical analyses of the corresponding fouling sites on the membrane surface using scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The PSD approach will be used to characterize fouling in a laboratory setting using synthetic wastewater. These findings will be compared with data from a pilot-scale AnMBR reactor system to understand the effect of realistic environmental variables on membrane biofouling. The knowledge gained from these studies will inform rational AnMBR operation and treatment strategies that inhibit specific organisms, and will lead to the development of improved anti-fouling membrane materials. Beyond these bench and pilot scale systems, the PSD method can also be used to uncover microbial assembly mechanisms in other wastewater treatment systems where biofouling is a limiting issue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

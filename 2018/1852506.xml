<AbstractNarration>Hydrologic challenges in urban areas of the world provide a compelling reason to engage undergraduate students in multidisciplinary urban hydrologic research. Drought, overuse, degradation, and population growth are causing significant stress upon urban areas. With 55% of the world's population residing in urban areas and urban populations expanding, it is key to train a future generation of scientists to tackle urban hydrologic problems. Another challenge is that underserved groups are inadequately represented in the hydrologic workforce and are, thus, often not involved in policy decisions that directly impact their communities. To address these concerns, this project presents a vertically integrated set of mentor-focused education and research experiences to provide career pathways for undergraduate students from underrepresented backgrounds in the field of urban hydrology. Our proposal aims to attract motivated students from underrepresented backgrounds to investigate urban hydrological problems through a nested series of events during a 10-week Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) summer training program.  Program activities include independent research, professional training, mentoring, social activities, a research and training field activity, and post-summer activities. The REU research activities include investigations in five topical areas: (1) surface hydrology of urban areas; (2) climate-driven changes in urban groundwater; (3) meteorology and precipitation along coastal urban corridors; (4) hydrochemistry of urban streams/hydrochemical methods development, and; (5) river sedimentation and restoration in urban coastal watersheds. The intellectual merit of this proposal is established through undergraduate engagement in high-level urban hydrologic research. Student research on urban hydrologic systems will provide an understanding of important hydrologic processes in urban watersheds. The research will contribute to the understanding of climate and anthropogenic-forced change in urban hydrologic systems that require additional study and long-term monitoring. The broader impacts of the proposal are focused on recruiting and retaining students from underrepresented backgrounds in the hydrological sciences.  As a result, this effort aims to expand representation in water resources decision making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU program provides multidisciplinary training and education focused on urban hydrology affected by climate change, and challenges of integrating diversity and demographic equity in policy and technical decisions.  Objectives of the program are to: 1) provide students an enriching and cultural experience under the guidance and mentorship of a core group of faculty with research interests in fields of urban hydrology; 2) increase the number of students pursuing advanced degrees in water-related fields, such as hydrogeology, watershed analysis, and hydrologic modeling, and; 3) increase the number of underrepresented students and especially those that do not have access to research opportunities and/or professional development, providing exposure/training in research and opportunities for these students to pursue graduate degrees or employment. To accomplish these objectives, the REU program includes engagement in supervised research, training activities, mentoring activities, social activities, a research and training field activity, and post-REU activities. Research activities include investigations in five topical areas: (1) surface hydrology of urban areas; (2) climate-driven changes in urban groundwater; (3) meteorology and precipitation along coastal urban corridors; (4) hydrochemistry of urban streams/hydrochemical methods development, and; (5) river sedimentation and restoration in California coastal watersheds. Training activities include half-day workshops for undergraduate mentees covering several professional topics including developing computing skills in the Spatial and Temporal Data Analysis short course, technical writing/abstract preparation, and poster/oral presentation. Mentoring activities include Friday afternoon meetings between REU students plus faculty and graduate students where they have informal discussions related to career and professional development and challenges.  Social activities include three weekend social events to create bonds between REU students and faculty peers. A combination research and training activity includes a four-day field trip through the lower part of the Colorado River Basin scheduled for the end of the third week. After the summer REU activity is complete, faculty mentors will continue to work with student mentees to finalize the dissemination of the REU research results through conference publications and presentations by the student participants and to provide career guidance as practicable.  We expect the REU effort to help lead students into productive research enterprises after their term in the program is complete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

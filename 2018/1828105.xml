<AbstractNarration>Future computing nodes will most likely rely on heterogeneous processing and memory systems as well as networking technologies. Identifying the most suitable computing system for a given application requires the cumbersome task of evaluating the application's performance on as many alternatives as possible. This project develops ESPRIT (Emerging Systems PeRformance and Energy Evaluation Instrument and Testbench), a computing system capable of evaluating the most suitable system for specific classes of applications. If applications can be classified into groups based on their similarities along a wide range of performance characteristics, it may be possible to determine the system best suited for a specific class of applications. This work will help large-scale computing systems be configured for more efficient operation and lower energy use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ESPRIT project consist of state of the art computing nodes; system, memory, and power and energy simulators; benchmarks from different applications; a suite of measuring instruments; models for investigating application behaviors; statistical clustering and other machine learning techniques.The merit of this project resides in the development of instruments to evaluate applications along a number of performance characteristics of behaviors and classifying them into clusters in order to identify the most suitable design for energy efficiencies by varying capacities as well as technology scales. ESPRIT could be used to investigate new design choices, or tune applications for specific designs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

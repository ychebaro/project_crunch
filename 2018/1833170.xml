<AbstractNarration>Now in its 47th year, the International Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP) is one of the longest continuously running conferences in parallel processing, and it is a rewarding event for Ph.D. graduate students to connect with and learn from the parallel computing community.  The Ph.D. Forum at ICPP promotes the progress of science as stated by NSF's mission by creating a rich educational and learning experience where Ph.D. graduate students (i) present and discuss their research in parallel computing with conference attendees, (ii) expand their understanding of the parallel computing by attending technical sessions, (iii) explore potential research projects with new colleagues, and (iv) receive guidance from leaders in the field.  By assisting in the training, development, and mentorship of the next-generation of parallel computing researchers, the ICPP Ph.D. Forum is contributing to the NSF's mission for advancements in science, support for education and diversity, and broader benefits to society.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;This award will support the travel of up to 24 eligible students from US-based institutions to participate in the student program at ICPP 2018 and to organize a PhD Forum. There are two main objectives of the Ph.D. Forum at ICPP.  First, it provides Ph.D. students with intellectual opportunities to discuss their research work in a constructive and supportive environment where leading parallel computing topics are presented and debated.  Second, it provides mentoring resources to help graduate students organize their academic research work and plan for their future careers.  The Ph.D. Forum makes it possible for graduate students to (i) present their research during the poster session, (ii) give a 2-3 minute introduction during a Ph.D. mentor luncheon, (iii) attend a special parallel computing career session, (iv) meet and interact with designated faculty and industry mentors during the conference, and (v) distribute their research materials (poster, abstract) and CV to other ICPP participants.  A Ph.D. Forum award acknowledges best overall poster, introduction, and participation.  An associated objective is to lay the groundwork for continuation of the Ph.D. Forum in future years of ICPP.  For this purpose, Ph.D. students provide feedback on their experience at ICPP and thoughts for improvements in the Ph.D. Forum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

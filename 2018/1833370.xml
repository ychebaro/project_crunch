<AbstractNarration>This project supports the 9th international Gordon Research Conference titled "2018 Gordon Research Conference on Biogenic Hydrocarbons and the Atmosphere: Connecting Volatiles and the Climate System from Leaf to Planet." Biogenic hydrocarbons are volatile compounds that are released naturally by vegetation and play an important role in ecosystems and atmospheric chemistry across a variety of scales.  The conference will impact society by improving the understanding of biosphere-atmosphere trace gas exchange and the role of human activities in global environmental change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The participants in this Gordon Research Conference will accomplish four important results. First, the most up-to-date science of biogenic hydrocarbon biosynthesis, ecological functions, ecosystem-atmosphere interactions, emissions, atmospheric transport, and associated chemical transformation will be summarized. Second, the conference participants will devise new research strategies to address emerging questions in the field of biogenic hydrocarbons in a world undergoing rapid physical and chemical changes.  Particular emphasis will be placed on developing research strategies to quantify the contribution of biogenic hydrocarbons on secondary aerosol formation. A third outcome of this Gordon Research Conference is the participation of junior scientists in the oral and poster presentations described above.  The meeting organizers will also make special efforts to invite and secure the participation of female colleagues.  A final outcome of this conference will be to encourage the participation and engagement of scientists from diverse fields to explore the potential for cross-disciplinary, state-of-the-art science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address the various topics associated with biogenic hydrocarbons, the 2018 Gordon Research Conference on "Biogenic Hydrocarbons and the Atmosphere" will take place in Switzerland from June 10-15, 2018.  NSF funding will provide support for registration fees and/or travel support for participants, with preference given to post docs and graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

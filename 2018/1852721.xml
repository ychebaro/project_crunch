<AbstractNarration>Cleveland State University, together with the Teaching Institute for Excellence in STEM (TIES), will design and pilot ways for computer science (CS) faculty to engage with and contribute to preK-12 CS learning opportunities in their communities. The two-year project, called CompPath (for Composing Pathways for Collaboration Between Computer Science Researchers and Practitioners) will explore the creation of meaningful and authentic connections between cutting-edge computer science research and K-12. It will emphasize the translation of research products in a manner that broadens participation by being inclusive of, and appealing to, women, people of color, and other under-represented minorities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the project will &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&gt; Create demonstrative collaborations between researchers that will serve as models to other computing researchers across the country; &lt;br/&gt;&gt; Collect an inventory of opportunities that a CS researcher can leverage to incorporate outreach activities in their research project in a sustainable and authentic manner;&lt;br/&gt;&gt; Design and launch a searchable clearinghouse infrastructure that will allow CS researchers and other Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM)-related groups located in proximate regions to easily find each other; and&lt;br/&gt;&gt; Host a series of "design studio" events that are focused on meaningful collaborations between CS researchers and providers of Broadening Participation in Computing resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In its dissemination, the project will leverage the network of the STEM Learning Ecosystems Community of Practice (SLECoP), an initiative comprising 68 communities across the US focused on dynamic, cross-sector STEM engagement&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

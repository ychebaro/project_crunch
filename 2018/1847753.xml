<AbstractNarration>The Network Embedded Storage and Compute (NESCO) project is motivated by a premise that future Research and Education networks should include "embedded compute and storage" functions as a mechanism to provide advanced services for domain science application workflows. This is a natural follow-on to the current cyberinfrastructure evolution revolving around "Cloud" and "Edge" computing.  The NESCO project is developing the next important trend based on a distributed ecosystem of compute and storage facilities which are embedded deeply within networks.  These will be similar in function to on-premise edge cloud deployments but will be customized for placement within networks.  Application workflow developers will have access to a new class of services which can be rapidly tailored to specific flows and use cases.  One result anticipated is the "democratization of middlebox" functions in a manner where application workflow developers can customize their workflows and data processing on real-time basis with flow level granularity.  This project includes a climate science workflow as a prototype use case.  It is anticipated that these new services will be of interest to a broad range of domain science applications.  Individual and small research groups who cannot afford access to dedicated resources may find these services of particular value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A NESCO facility is defined which can be placed inside of Wide Area Networks, Regional Networks, and Exchange Points.  These facilities will contain advanced programmable hardware-based network functions, compute and storage resources, and be architected to provide services on a highly customizable per flow basis.  An open source orchestration system known as StackV is being modified to develop a new class of realtime "Flow Management" services.  The StackV system includes a realtime modeling framework to "datafy" infrastructure, modular pluggable computation elements, and intelligent workflow processes to build on-demand topologies across heterogeneous resource types and service providers.  This system also includes a user facing application programming interface which allows workflow agents to request resource topologies which span network, compute, and storage resources via a single integrated request.  This project is developing a NESCO reference implementation which will be deployed for testing and experimentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

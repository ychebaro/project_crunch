<AbstractNarration>The Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) and Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Marine Microbes together create an international forum for sharing cutting-edge research on the ecology, evolution, and function of microorganisms in the ocean biosphere. The meeting brings together top scientists from around the world with diverse backgrounds and expertise to provide an integrated program on marine microbial life, covering cutting edge research on viruses, Bacteria, Archaea and Eurkarya protists, spanning pelagic and benthic realms, trophic food web dynamics (photoautrophy, chemoautotrophy, heterotrophy and mixotrophy) and their interactions and impact on biogeochemical cycles. Both the Seminar and Conference are organized in thematic sessions, with the goal of highlighting new methodological approaches and emerging questions in the field while stimulating rigorous discussion. Requested funds enable early career participants (postdoctoral researchers and graduate students in the marine microbiology research community with diverse backgrounds) to attend both the 2018 Gordon Research Seminar and Gordon Research Conference on Marine Microbes. The rationale is to facilitate the attendance and participation of postdocs and graduate students in the GRS so they have an opportunity to present their research among peer scientists and gain confidence in this setting. The GRS will expose young, early-career scientists to cutting-edge research on marine microbes (ranging from evolution to biogeochemistry to ecology to meta-omics), provide opportunities to network among peers, and foster relationships that will hopefully lead to lifelong collaborations. It will also provide career guidance and scientific mentoring through the participation of select senior-level research mentors and discussion leaders. The GRS will also increase student and postdoc participation in the subsequent GRC, which will expose them to the state-of-the-art research occurring in the field. The GRC will have oral presentations from a diverse group of young and established scientists who play leading roles in marine microbial research. Discussion leaders, who are also leaders in their field, have &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The respective themes of the 2018 Marine Microbes GRS and GRC are "Marine Microbial Strategies for Survival in a Changing Environment" and "Elucidating Microbial Processes Across Spatial and Temporal Scales". These GRC and GRS themes draw upon challenges and opportunities in marine microbiology and the interactive microbial ocean in order to help develop the conceptual agenda to help drive the community forward in integrating microbial processes with an eye on putting them in an Earth Systems context. The Marine Microbes GRC and GRS are arguably the only meetings that coalesce such a diverse array of researchers (from various professional stages) related to marine microbes. Its duration and unique format for presentation and emphasis on personal interactions represents an exceptional opportunity for exchanging scientific ideas, generating new ideas, and building new collaborations. A critical part of achieving those goals is to help to get a diverse array of scientists to the meeting site (both are co-located).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

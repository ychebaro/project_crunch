<AbstractNarration>High-speed connectivity to remote state and national cyberinfrastructure resources such as advanced computing systems, data stores, and scientific instrumentation is crucial in states like South Dakota. For this project, the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (SDSM&amp;T) and Black Hills State University (BHSU) are collaborating with the University of South Dakota (USD) to transform the way campus and state networks are designed and operated by addressing the unique challenges of deploying accessible cyberinfrastructure in a rural state. Specifically, SDSM&amp;T and BHSU are building out campus network infrastructure in support of multidisciplinary research and education including: advanced imaging and microscopy, underground science, weather prediction, and high throughput genetic sequencing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a system architecture conceived and designed in year 1 and deployed in year 2 this project aims to increase STEM research and education productivity in western South Dakota by re-architecting campus networks and regional aggregation points so that they are optimized for current and future research and education applications. Architectural characteristics include aspects of the Science DMZ approach to streamline academic data flows; improved wired and wireless connections within and between science buildings and the network core; network measurement leveraging existing campus edge PerfSONAR nodes as well as new nodes at each campus core; data transfer nodes based on the Flash IO Network Appliance; and Globus middleware for data movement. With guidance from state, regional, and national advisors this collaboration is establishing an aggregation model for accessible cyberinfrastructure in rural regions where under-resourced institutions are the norm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

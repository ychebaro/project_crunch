<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the meeting "Workshop in Operator Theory : Recent Trends and Applications " a workshop that will take place during May 3-5, 2018, on the campus of the University of Memphis in Memphis, Tennessee. Additional information about the conference can be found on the website http://www.memphis.edu/msci/rtota2018/index.php&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the meeting "Workshop in Operator Theory : Recent Trends and Applications" is on long-standing open problems in operator theory. It will also provide an update on recent important contributions to the field. A concerted effort will be made to include underrepresented graduate students, including women, and early career mathematicians in the workshop. In addition, it planned to create a future network of support and interaction among participants to enable further research and collaboration. This will be an significant conference in operator theory and funding that will offer early career mathematicians and members of underrepresented groups the opportunity to become involved in state-of-the-art research in operator theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>This award supports research into algebraic geometry, a subject concerned with the study of systems of polynomial equations in many variables.  The solutions to such systems give rise to algebraic varieties, which are fundamental objects of study in algebraic geometry.  Algebraic topology is the study of systematically attaching algebraic invariants (numbers or abstract algebraic structures) to spaces; such invariants do not depend on the way a space is pulled or twisted (without tearing it).  It is natural to try to analyze algebraic varieties using the tools of algebraic topology.  However, when algebraic varieties do not have obvious "spatial structure," such as when they arise in arithmetic settings, then a new approach is required.  The project under consideration seeks to analyze algebraic invariants of algebraic varieties using a new framework.  This theory allows one to apply the full power of techniques of algebraic topology to objects of interest in algebraic geometry -- one may treat spaces having complicated arithmetic structure, but a priori limited geometric structure, in essentially the same way as more classical spaces.  The current project seeks to analyze certain classical algebraic and arithmetic questions using these new techniques and to provide a better understanding of specific systems of algebraic equations, which is fundamental to many areas of mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator will study questions regarding projective modules over commutative unital algebras over a field, and related topological and arithmetic questions, by means of the Morel-Voevodsky A1-homotopy theory.  Among other topics, the project investigates the following concrete (and classical) questions.  Given a complex algebraic variety, which topological vector bundles admit algebraic structures?  How many algebraic vector bundles are there on a smooth affine variety over a finite field (say with fixed invariants)?  By their very nature, these questions draw together several branches of mathematics and thus illustrate the fundamental unity of the subject.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

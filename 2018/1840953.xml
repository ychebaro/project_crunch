<AbstractNarration>This innovative project, E3: Excellence in Engineering Education-A Workshops Series for School Administrators, carried out by Stony Brook University (SBU) will broaden participation in engineering and facilitate implementation of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) in K-12 school districts in New York City and on Long Island, with a focus on grades 6-12 and on high needs settings. The project team will create, implement, investigate and evaluate a workshops series for school administrators that will increase passion, competence and engagement for engineering, a profession that contributes to social and economic mobility.  The proposed E3 workshops will engage district administrators in building awareness and knowledge in engineering to support the unique needs of pre-college students, particularly those from populations traditionally underrepresented. E3 will offer a total of eight workshops that will span two academic years.  The primary mechanism will be a series of annual professional development workshops, two for school district leadership (superintendents/assistant superintendents and principals), and two for district/school science directors; each type of workshop will be held on both Long Island and in New York City to maximize participation. The workshops series is unique and innovative because it focuses on two documented weaknesses in the engineering education gateway: 1) the lack of engineering instruction in pre-college education, and 2) chronic socioeconomic disparities in engineering participation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed E3 workshops series will advance knowledge in engineering education, facilitating the implementation of the NGSS as the project team organizes, provides, and evaluates professional development for school leaders in grade 6-12 settings, particularly those in high needs schools.  The workshops are unique as they will include strategies for NGSS adoption for administrators, whose acquired skills and knowledge will impact students, counselors, and teachers. A rigorous research plan and evaluation will measure outcomes, providing data related to the participants as well as school-level practices.  E3 will result into a replicable and scalable model to promote engineering and NGSS implementation in regional schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

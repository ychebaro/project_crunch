<AbstractNarration>This award provides partial support for the 33rd Summer Conference on Topology and its Applications, to be held July 17-20, 2018, at Western Kentucky University.  This conference series showcases advances in topology and applications to areas such as algebra, analysis, and computer science.  Special sessions in topology applied to materials properties and in knot theory applied to the physical science will provide opportunities to foster interdisciplinary collaborations.  To encourage scientific awareness in the community, Michael Kosterlitz, 2016 Nobel Laureate in Physics, will deliver a public lecture on applications of topology in physics. Each of the seven special sessions will include presentations by students, early career researchers, and established scholars, and will encourage participation from women and scholars from underrepresented groups.  The peer-reviewed journal Topology Proceedings will have a special issue for papers presented at this conference. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The conference will have special sessions in Topology in Analysis and Topological Algebras (dedicated to W. W. Comfort), Set-theoretic Topology, Topological Methods in Geometric Group Theory, Dynamical Systems and Continuum Theory, Asymmetric Topology, Applications of Knot Theory to Physical Sciences, and The Interplay of Topology and Materials Properties.   To foster the sharing of ideas across the sub-disciplines, each session will have a plenary speaker.  Besides the applications within mathematics included in all sessions, these sessions will include interdisciplinary applications to physics (Materials Properties), biology (Knot Theory), and computer science (Asymmetric Topology). Further details are available at the conference website:&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;https://sites.google.com/site/summertopology2018/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

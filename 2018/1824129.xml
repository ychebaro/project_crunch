<AbstractNarration>The project provides for travel and registration costs for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to attend the 2018 Gordon Research Conference Seminar on Integrated Approaches to Rock Deformation. The conference will be held at Proctor Academy in Andover, New Hampshire from August 19th to the 24th, 2018. In additional to the conference itself, there will be a Research Seminar the weekend prior (August 18th, 19th), which will focus on research contributions from early career researchers. The activities supported by this proposal include cutting-edge present cutting-edge research that spans a range of methodologies and materials, over a variety of spatial and temporal scales, to develop an integrated perspective on rock deformation. The program will showcase recent advances and future trends in rock deformation and applications in structural geology, seismology, geodesy, geodynamics, planetary geology, and energy &amp; environmental engineering. The GRS provides a unique opportunity for early-career scientists to come together in a highly stimulating and non-intimidating environment to discuss current research and build networks that can lead to a lifetime of collaboration and scientific achievement. In addition, the project will contribute to broadening of participation of underrepresented groups in science, technology, and mathematics (STEM) through recruitment of participants from underrepresented groups. The Gordon Research Conference and associated Gordon Research Seminar will foster development of new research directions in rock mechanics and will contribute to the development of a diverse and globally competitive STEM workforce. The conference program includes topics of societal relevance that bear on the understanding of geologic hazards, which is of benefit to society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

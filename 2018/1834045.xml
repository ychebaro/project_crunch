<AbstractNarration>The NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) program will support the retention and graduation of high-achieving, low-income students with demonstrated financial need at Middlesex Community College and Northeastern University.  Over a five-year period, this project will fund annual scholarships to 165 students pursuing biotechnology degrees through the entire pathway from associate's to master's degrees.  Responding to national concerns about the high cost of postsecondary education and the demand for biotechnology professionals, this project will offer a low-cost, accelerated alternative to earn degrees and enter careers in biotechnology.  Specifically, in addition to providing scholarships, the program will embed students in a supportive, accelerated pathway that prepares them for academic success and for biotechnology careers in the greater Boston metro area.  With strong industry support, together with existing infrastructure and articulation agreements between Northeastern University and Middlesex Community College, this program aims to encourage, enhance, and accelerate student engagement in academic preparation, career development, and entry into the STEM workforce.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to provide appropriately tailored pathways to STEM credentials tied to entry-level biotechnology jobs that are in demand in the Boston area.  The project will facilitate participation in undergraduate research and paid internships (an academic program requirement at both institutions), industry and peer mentorship, specialized advising, and other tailored academic, career, and social supports that are recognized by researchers as high impact practices in broadening participation and increasing retention.  A robust faculty professional development effort focused on inclusion will also be implemented, in collaboration with an ongoing Howard Hughes Medical Institute Inclusive Excellence project within the College of Science at Northeastern University.  Industry partnerships have been established to ensure that the programs are aligned with industry demands and the changing biotechnology field.  Drawing on social capital theory, the quantitative mixed methods research study will test three hypotheses focused on student performance, financial stress, career self-efficacy, professional connections, and expanded social capital.  Utilizing a comparison group design, the project will generate evidence about the efficacy of strategies and interventions for increasing student success in STEM degree pathways by testing four categories of student academic and student support services (a) academic supports, (b) social inclusion and connectedness, (c) financial stress reduction, and (d) career-related activities.  Over the life of the project, the project will award 530 annual scholarships to academically talented low income students.  Results of this project will contribute to the STEM workforce and understanding of strategies to support the success of lower income students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

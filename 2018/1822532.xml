<AbstractNarration>Oregon State University proposes to support technical services on R/V Oceanus, a 177? general purpose research vessel as part of the US Academic Fleet scheduled by University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS).  The vessel is owned by the National Science Foundation. The proposal requests support for both basic and specialized services.  For basic services, they will provide one or two shipboard technicians on each cruise of R/V Oceanus to support seagoing research projects and to maintain, calibrate and provide for qualified users items from their pool of shared-use research instrumentation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts       &lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

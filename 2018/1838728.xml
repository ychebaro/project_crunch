<AbstractNarration>This proposal describes the repair of critical infrastructure at Arecibo Observatory (AO) damaged by Hurricane Maria in September 2017.  The repairs conducted in this supplement include the most urgent: site backup power (including repairing and rewinding three out of the four site generators and installation of a solar backup array), building repairs, inspections of critical infrastructure, and preparations for more complicated repairs (e.g. engineering studies for the replacement of the line feed that was completely destroyed during Hurricane Maria). The proposal outlines the planned activities in detail, all of which are in support of returning the site to a world-class working science observatory. Observations obtained by AO contribute to the fulfillment of scientific goals set out by the astronomy, planetary science, ionospheric physics, and the space weather communities. The radar system at AO is a unique asset, but currently cannot be used due to the needed generator repairs. Until these repairs are conducted, radar-imaging of near-earth asteroids, for example, is not possible. The observation and categorization of near-earth objects (NEOs) is a Congressional mandate. AO is one of the leading education and public outreach centers worldwide, and a top attraction for students in Puerto Rico.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

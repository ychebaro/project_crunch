<AbstractNarration>This award will provide support for US based researchers to attend conferences and workshops, which will take place as part of the thematic program on Descriptive Set Theory and Polish Groups at the Bernoulli Center at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Lausanne, Switzerland from January 1 until June 30, 2018.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Descriptive set theory is classically defined as the study of definable sets in Polish spaces - those topological spaces which are separable and completely metrizable.  The subject has long thrived in its connections with classical areas of mathematics such as harmonic and functional analysis and logic. Over the course of the last 25 years, however, a vast number of new interactions have opened up the field to novel and exciting directions. The semester long program will organize a number of activities in and around modern aspects of descriptive set theory and its links with other areas of mathematics. An important focus is to facilitate research on the structure of Polish topological groups, which recently has gathered momentum partially due to work in descriptive set theory.

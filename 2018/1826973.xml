<AbstractNarration>This grant supports the participation of undergraduate students in the AAAI Student Outreach Workshop, to be held in conjunction with the AAAI (Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence) and EAAI (Educational Applications of Artificial Intelligence) conferences, February 2-7, 2018 in New Orleans.  This outreach program is aimed at undergraduate students with an interest in AI or Robotics.  Through this workshop, students will work with the Cozmo robot and the Calypso robot intelligence framework to gain hands-on experience in applying artificial intelligence to a commercial robot.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This activity will expose undergraduate students to practical skills and research issues involved in developing systems with robust intelligence.  The activity promotes student interest in artificial intelligence and autonomous robots for future education and development. The workshop also contributes to the development of effective methods for teaching about artificial intelligence, which has the potential to impact the computer science and engineering education community's ability to recruit future researchers and workforce more broadly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

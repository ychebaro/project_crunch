<AbstractNarration>In response to and in alignment with an effort undertaken by the National Science Foundation's Computer and Information Systems and Engineering (CISE) Directorate to increase broadening participation in computing (BPC) activities among its Principal Investigators (PIs), the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) and the National 4-H Council (4-H) will pilot an effort to support CISE PIs in engaging underserved youth in computer science(CS) - specifically computational and algorithmic thinking - during out-of-school time settings.  The project will develop a CS Professional Development (CSPD) toolkit that includes real-world, video-based learning modules, facilitated in-person professional development opportunities, and distance learning experiences to support educators in encouraging youth to develop their CS skills. Materials in the toolkit with be developed and, in some cases, delivered by members of the CISE community. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;4-H reaches nearly six million youth through the nation's land grant university (LGU) system, and has already embarked on a partnership with Google to teach youth both technical and interpersonal skills at three LGUs. This proposal will expand upon that foundation by developing, designing, and testing CS professional development resources at those three 4-H OST CS sites. The resources will then be packaged into a transferable toolkit that can be eventually scaled to reach the 600,000 volunteers and 3,500 educators that currently facilitate 4-H programming within LGUs and potentially opening the door for many additional members of the CISE community to contribute to 4H activities on a regular basis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

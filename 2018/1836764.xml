<AbstractNarration>The proposed funding will be used to offset costs for students to travel to the 37th International Symposium on Combustion, Ireland, July 29 to August 3, 2018. The supported students are expected to have authored or co-authored accepted papers and to present them in person at the Symposium. It is anticipated that the funds will support 45 students, with $1,000 for each person. The International Symposium on Combustion is the most prestigious technical conference in the combustion community. By attending this meeting, students will be exposed to the state-of-the-art combustion research and have a chance to network with other researchers and practicing engineers. This experience will greatly enhance their scientific knowledge as well as professional careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this project is to provide partial support for the 2019 Dynamics Days conference to be held January 4-6, 2019, on the campus of Northwestern University and at the Hilton Orrington Hotel in Evanston, Illinois. Dynamics Days is an annual conference on nonlinear dynamics and its applications.  It has established itself as a premier conference for promoting new collaborations in applied math and nonlinear science; it has been hosted at rotating sites in the US for nearly 40 years (since 1982).  Due to the broad applicability of nonlinear dynamics, the conference is highly interdisciplinary, including areas such as physics, engineering, mathematics, biology, and computer science.  This year, the focus of the conference will be on six themes: neuroscience, complex fluids, data-driven &amp; machine learning methods, nonlinear materials, complex networks, and human/biological systems. The main goals of the conference are to gather leading researchers with young investigators and students to promote cross fertilization and dissemination of ideas, and to engage students. The conference webpage is http://ddays2019.northwestern.edu/. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The conference will have 16 invited speakers and a similar number of contributed talks, as well as short "flash" presentations and poster sessions.  No parallel sessions will take place; all attendees are expected to attend all talks in order to promote discussion across application fields.  Support provided by the NSF will be used primarily to offer scholarships to allow participation of undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars.  Participants from underrepresented groups will be especially encouraged to attend the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

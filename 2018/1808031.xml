<AbstractNarration>Proteins are the microscopic workhorses of biology and are able to exquisitely perform a wide variety of functions when used in biotechnology.  A common problem with proteins though is their poor stability to environmental conditions. Proteins can rapidly lose activity at elevated temperatures or in chemically harsh environments.  A common strategy employed to address this issue is to directly attach a polymer to the protein to improve upon stability.  Prof. Pokorski and his team at the University of California, San Diego are designing new approaches to streamline the synthesis of protein-polymer hybrids, introduce new function into the polymeric element, and develop methods to modify the protein precisely without impairing its natural function. Furthermore, the team will utilize the research platform to train high school, undergraduate and graduate students to continue to position our nation as a leader in science and technology for future generations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Pokorski and his team are developing approaches to perform ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) directly from the surface of a protein macroinitiator. ROMP is challenging under aqueous environments and in complex media that includes proteins.  The team aims to optimize grafting-from chemistry in order to precisely control molecular weight, introduce new function to the polymers, and site-specifically label proteins distal to their active sites. The research focuses on three specific aims: 1) optimizing the protein macroinitiator complex to create living polymerization process where molecular weight and dispersity are easily controlled, 2) expand the monomer scope to include zwitterions, oxanorbornenes, and cyclooctene monomers, and 3) site-specifically label proteins and the N- and C-terminus, as well as specific amino acids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

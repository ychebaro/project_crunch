<AbstractNarration>This proposal requests funds to enable 14 students to attend the 25th annual &lt;br/&gt;25th annual Radio Frequency Ionospheric Interactions (RFII) Workshop in Arlington, VA during July 29-August 1, 2018. The RFII Workshop is a scientific workshop focused on &lt;br/&gt;the interaction of high-power RF waves from ground-based transmitters with the ionospheric plasma. The effects include (but are not limited to) artificial generation of aurorae and ionospheric irregularities. The topics covered by this workshop are of interest not only to the Aeronomy radio science subcommunity, but also to the wider Atmospheric and Geospace science communities. These topics are also highlighted at assembly meetings such as the AGU and the IUGG. Student participation is a strong element of the RFII workshop, which affords them the opportunity to network with scientific leaders.  The workshop also exposes students to work performed at cutting edge research facilities, such as HAARP and Arecibo Observatory. These encounters are strong motivators for future careers in upper atmospheric and space sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

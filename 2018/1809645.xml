<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spiders are the masters of silk: a typical web-spinning spider produces at least six different silks, each synthesized and spun by different silk glands and spinnerets located on its abdomen. The ultimate goal of this research is to be able to mimic this process and materials in the laboratory.  Silk fibers produced by spiders are protein-based and currently there is not a good molecular understanding of the structure responsible for the "high-performance" mechanical properties of spider silks.  Understanding the molecular structure, dynamics and the hierarchical organizations in spider silk proteins is critical to the ultimate goal of producing materials in the lab with properties comparable to natural spider silk fibers. This research group plans to explore the molecular structure, protein-protein interactions, and hierarchical structures formed in silk proteins (the silks that produce dragline and web-building for spiders). This research will establish relationships between hierarchical structure and mechanical function in a variety of natural silk proteins from several different spiders, including orb-weaving, cob-weaving and jumping spiders.  This is a critical component to realize silk biomimicry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A single orb-weaving spider produces up to 6 different types of biopolymer fibers that are commonly called silk.  These silk fibers produced by spiders are protein-based biopolymers and span a large range of physical and mechanical properties. Currently, there is not a comprehensive molecular and hierarchical understanding of the protein structures responsible for the "high-performance" mechanical properties of spider silks.  The critical component of spider silk fibers is the fact that they are almost completely protein based, and clearly contain a complex set of secondary protein structures, nanocrystalline domains and hierarchical organizations of these molecular level structures.  Understanding the molecular structure and the hierarchical organizations in spider silk proteins is critical to the ultimate goal of producing a protein-based material with properties similar to natural spider silk fibers. This research group plans to explore the molecular structure, protein-protein interactions, and hierarchical structures formed in major and minor ampullate silk proteins (dragline and web-building) with an ultimate goal to establish relationships between hierarchical structure and mechanical function in a variety of natural silk proteins from several evolutionarily different spiders, including orb-weaving (Araneus), cob-weaving (Latrodectus) and jumping (Peucetia) spiders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>Bermuda Institute of Ocean Science (BIOS) proposes to support technical services on R/V Atlantic Explorer, a general purpose, intermediate class research vessel operated by BIOS as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet.  The proposal requests support for basic services.  They will provide at least two shipboard technicians on most cruises of R/V Atlantic Explorer to support seagoing research projects and to maintain calibrate and provide for qualified users items from their pool of shared-use research instrumentation.  In addition, they will utilize technicians via the technician exchange program and the UNOLS Tech Pool. The costs for the techs will be deducted from the award. The budget included with this proposal is for the first year of a 5-year continuing award. The out-years will be negotiated with the Program with the receipt of the annual report.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts       &lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

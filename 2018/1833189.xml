<AbstractNarration>This award provides partial support for three editions of the Tech Topology Conference, beginning with the meeting at Georgia Tech in Atlanta on December 7-9, 2018, the eighth conference in the series. The conference provides an opportunity for topologists from around the country to convene for a weekend of talks on the latest developments in the field. The speakers, selected for the quality of their results, their presentation skills, and their contributions to promoting a diverse and inclusive environment, range from internationally renowned mathematicians to rising young stars. The conference features seven hour-long talks, complemented by three lightning talk sessions, which give junior researchers the opportunity to give a five minute presentation on their work. The schedule includes ample time for informal discussions amongst participants and speakers, providing opportunities for mentorship and collaboration. The grant will help support the travel expenses of graduate students, early career researchers, and speakers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This year's Tech Topology Conference will focus on geometric group theory and low-dimensional topology. These are both very active fields of research, both in the Southeast and beyond; four of this year's seven speakers are based in the Southeast. The conference serves as an opportunity to bring leading researchers to the Southeast and highlight the some of the recent results obtained by junior researchers in the region. The conference organizer will continue posting notes from the talks online in order to make materials from the conference publicly available. The conference website can be found at http://ttc.gatech.edu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

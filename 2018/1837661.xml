<AbstractNarration>This proposal builds on an existing researcher-practitioner partnership between Northwestern University and Evanston/Skokie School District 65 in Illinois to develop a shared platform and professional development framework that supports computational learning across a network of schools, community centers, libraries, and homes. The current proposal seeks to develop ways to curate and structure learning activities in and outside of schools in ways that engage youth in long-term projects, demonstrate both the personal and professional value of computer programming, and exemplify computation as a means to achieve creative and personally fulfilling goals. The project explores a model for broadening participation in computer science and related fields through a three-pronged approach involving programming, music, and dance. First, the researchers will provide learners with tools that engage them in computational projects that are personally, socially, and culturally meaningful. Second, the project will develop a continuum of music-themed computer science learning opportunities designed to work between and across school and out-of-school spaces. Finally, the project will create and study innovative ways for learners to document their emerging understandings of both computer programming and music by adopting the computational notebook paradigm that is increasingly popular in data science and computational science communities (e.g., Jupyter, Wolfram Notebooks).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One premise of the research is that music is a dominant cultural form of literacy with many direct parallels to computer science concepts. Emerging genres in the digital arts have the potential to provide a motivational context for youth from groups chronically underrepresented in computing fields. The researchers will introduce students to computational thinking through two programming environments developed at Georgia Institute of Technology. A set of activities and programs across a network of learning spaces will also be designed to immerse students in computer programming. The researchers will use a variety of methods, including interviews, surveys, and artifact analysis, to document student learning across contexts and over time. By engaging with multiple partners in the researcher-practitioner partnerships, the researchers will develop a rich understanding of youth engagement and the ways that learning can be supported and reinforced across contexts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

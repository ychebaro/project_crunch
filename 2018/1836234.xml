<AbstractNarration>Microbial one carbon metabolism is central in the cycling of carbon and closely linked to the biogeochemical cycling of other major elements in the biosphere. For the past 25 years, the Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on the Molecular Basis of Microbial One-Carbon Metabolism has been one of the major international forums for discussing the latest research on this globally important topic. This proposal is requesting support to assist with U.S. student participation for the 2018 rendition of the GRC and Gordon Research Seminar. This financial support will offset the registration and partial travel for 6 students at the 2018 GRC conference and an additional 14 students at the 2-day student run GRS.  This monetary support is critical for ensuring representation and participation of early career scientists who may not otherwise attend due to insufficient funds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2018 GRC conference on the Molecular Basis of Microbial One-Carbon Metabolism will serve as an important venue for exchange of ideas and discussion of the latest findings in the field. Its format features extensive discussions, interactive poster sessions, and informal gatherings in the afternoons and evenings, providing an ideal setting for C1 researchers and students across different fields and generations to exchange ideas, brainstorm, and discuss opportunities for collaboration within the U.S. and abroad. This meeting is inherently inter-disciplinary and attracts some of the leading researchers in the field. Student participation in the conference is vital to the success of the meeting and critical for continued growth and progress of the C1 research field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

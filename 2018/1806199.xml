<AbstractNarration>This grant supports the workshop Energy Storage 2017: Opportunities and Challenges for Electric Grid, Wave, Hydropower and Other Sustainable Energies at Oregon State University on November 5-6, 2017. The objective of this workshop is for researchers from academia, national laboratories, and industry to discuss the fundamental and applied research needs for energy storage with renewable energy including wind, wave, and solar. The workshop will include topics on the fundamental issues of the use of battery packs for electric vehicles; and of large storage capacity systems to handle grid interconnections. The discussions will be focused on how robust these systems and electric grids are. The resilience in energy storage technologies will affect the choices of storage systems and their implementation with a given energy resource or application. The workshop will also address issues related to the commercialization and manufacturing of energy storage systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;National Science Foundation will provide travel funds and registration to support approximately 20 undergraduate and graduate students to attend the workshop. The organizers will emphasize broadening participation to encourage women and underrepresented minorities in STEM attendance. The students will have an opportunity to attend talks and poster sessions and network with faculty and national laboratory and industry researchers. The outcome of the workshop is a strategy to increase collaboration across universities, national laboratories, and industry for fundamental and applied research supporting energy storage for sustainable transport and electricity generation.</AbstractNarration>

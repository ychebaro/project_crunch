<AbstractNarration>This graduate student training workshop (Phys-Fest 2) is organized around group collection of plant ecophysiology data. Similar to the first workshop (Konza Prairie - 2016), a solid grounding in scientific research in ecophysiology will be achieved on-hands training, collegiality and interactive data collection. A key need exists for broad training in ecophysiology, as many graduate students have limited exposure to diverse ecophysiology equipment, techniques, and data interpretation. Phys-Fest 2 will fill this need through mentored research, close interaction with faculty instructors, and evening activities designed to teach effective science communication skills. Phys-Fest 2 will be hosted by the Holden Arboretum, a species-diverse, mature deciduous forest near Cleveland, OH. Holden Arboretum contains a suspended canopy walk and an emergent tower, both of which provide an 'in-canopy experience' to workshop participants. Scheduling this workshop at Holden provides a unique scientific opportunity, insight into non-academic careers for students, and opportunities for public engagement with day visitors at the arboretum. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This workshop (Phys-Fest 2) will focus on plant ecophysiology and deviate from the typical conference format of short presentations and posters.  Here, participants will collaborate using replicate pieces of equipment to measure leaf-level and whole-plant physiology in four broad categories: plant hydraulics, gas exchange, fluorescence, and thermal/hyperspectral imaging. Measurements will be taken at multiple canopy heights on replicated trees in conjunction with a distributed instrument array including NDVI, PRI, leaf wetness, canopy temperature, and microclimate sensors. This strategy will facilitate in-canopy physiological measurements, such as monitoring the response of forest tree canopies to diurnal variations. These measurements will demonstrate fundamental ecophysiological canopy processes, provide direct linkages to gradients in canopy microclimate, and will be useful for scaling processes at sub-canopy dynamics in deciduous forests. The organization of Phys-Fest 2 is specifically designed to promote networking and meaningful interactions among participants. Two types of training in science communication in the evenings of day 2 and 3 will be held. Holden Arboretum staff will provide short workshops on engaging public audiences and in science outreach and policy. Using the information learned during this training, student participants will interact with Holden visitors during the day with the goal of engaging a public audience, and disseminating ecophysiology principles in forest canopy research. Finally, course accomplishments will be disseminated through four media outlets at the Holden Arboretum: social media, print, video, and on-site interpretative materials.</AbstractNarration>

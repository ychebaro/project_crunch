<AbstractNarration>This grant supports student travel for select students to participate in the Doctoral Mentoring Consortium (DMC) at the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI) that will be held in Stockholm, Sweden, July 13-19, 2018. This is the premier international conference for researchers in artificial intelligence research across a fully international research community. This activity will bring together a broad community of researchers in the field of AI, and support junior researchers at this critical early-career stage.  The DMC creates the opportunity to bring in participants who might not have attended an AI conference due to lack of resources. This is especially true for those at smaller institutions and those which have less developed AI programs. Engaging such participants has the potential to draw more talent into AI research, improve research ideas in their formative stage, and engender collaborations across the breadth of disciplines.  This event provides students with invaluable exposure to outside perspectives on their work at a critical time in their research and enables them to explore their career objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

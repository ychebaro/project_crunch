<AbstractNarration>This project seeks to address the problem of preparing a robot to perform a set of known tasks, despite the lack of any information about the task to be performed or the environment in which it occurs. The approach taken is to construct an active robotic skin, integrating motion, sensing, and decision-making into a single conformable material skin with embedded sensors and actuators, and wrap it around a passive, moldable core material. The skin acts to deform the core, in such a way as to make the robot move, in a manner which is optimized for its surroundings using evolutionary algorithms. In preliminary work, the PI team has demonstrated an initially spherical robot first causing itself to roll, and then morphing to a cylinder and switching to an inchworm-type gait. This project will leverage novel insights from biological systems to derive new operational principles for robots capable of editing their own algorithmic control structure to make use of a changing anatomy, enabling more robust functionality. The results of this research will enable morphing robots that can adjust their morphology to accomplish different tasks or move more efficiently to meet the demands of changing environments or contexts. This project addresses the producing of a transformative tool that can adapt for exploration or discovery of unknown, dangerous, or unpredictable environments. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Rigid-bodied robots generally excel at specific tasks in structured environments, but lack the versatility and adaptability required to interact-with and locomote-within the natural world. This project will introduce robotic skins that wrap around arbitrary soft bodies to induce the desired motions and deformations. With the addition of robotic skins, passive soft bodies may be turned into active soft robots. Robotic skins integrate actuation, sensing, variable stiffness, and computation into a single conformable material, and may be leveraged to create morphing robots capable of editing their own morphology and control in unstructured and dynamic environments. The objective of the proposed work is to develop and implement an end-to-end procedure that begins with behavior specifications and ends with a physical self-morphing soft robot and its software environment. The approach will employ robotic skins as the foundation of morphing machines by wrapping them around moldable materials (e.g. clay), enabling surface-driven shape change. Robotic skins will mold the underlying body into a desired shape through controlled surface strains, surface pressures and selective stiffening. As the environment or task changes, the skin will re-mold the body into a new shape that is optimized for its context. This approach will leverage novel insights from diverse biological systems to derive new mathematical models, evolutionary algorithms, and multifunctional materials to enable unparalleled contextually-sensitive morphing capabilities for soft robots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly sponsored by the National Science Foundation, Office of Emerging Frontiers and Multidisciplinary Activities (EFMA) and the US Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

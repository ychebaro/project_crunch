<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for US participation in the conference "Madison Lectures in Fourier Analysis" that will be held May 13-17, 2019 at University of Wisconsin-Madison.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially on the topics of generalized Brascamp-Lieb inequalities, Fourier restriction problems, singular and fractional Radon transforms, and sparse bounds.   A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference.  This award gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, and researchers not funded by NSF, an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference.   The organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities.   More information will be made available at:  http://www.math.wisc.edu/seeger2019/?q=node/8&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

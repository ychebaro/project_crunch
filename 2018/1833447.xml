<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the conference "Symposium on Mathematical Statistics and Applications: From Time Series and Stochastics, to Semi- and Non-Parametrics, to High-Dimensional Models" held September 14 - 16, 2018 at Michigan State University. This conference is designed to benefit graduate students and early-career researchers in mathematical statistics. As the data revolution of the 21st century takes the US to new frontiers in data-based decision-making and predictive analytics in business and government, the role of the mathematically-trained and analytically-critical statistician remains more important than ever, to develop and analyze sound, innovative ways of understanding data science algorithms, methodologies, and procedures. The conference will bring together established and aspiring researchers from around the country and abroad to explore frontiers of mathematical statistics and a host of emerging applications. The exposure and networking opportunities provided by the conference to the dozens of graduate students and early-career researchers will be of great value, and potentially career-changing for some.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Foundational work to further develop the analysis and use of data in all its forms is underway in several areas, particularly in semi- and non-parametric statistics. Such mathematical development is needed across a wide spectrum of the statistical sciences, including high-dimensional statistical inference, non-parametric time series, functional data analysis, empirical processes, and machine learning. The conference will expose the participants to these topics as well as other directions, including asymptotic theory of adaptive and efficient estimation, time series in econometrics, and survival analysis. With ample time built into the schedule for discussions, the conference will give participants opportunities to engage in fruitful cross-group collaborations. A particularly impactful aspect of the conference is the inclusion of several presentations by local non-statisticians who work in areas typically underserved by statisticians but with very significant data analysis needs, all interested in interacting with statisticians from across the country with whom there would ordinarily be no chance to meet. Application areas covered will include quantitative finance, insurance mathematics and risk analytics, nuclear physics, agricultural economics, neuro-imaging, soil science, hospital management, hydrology, and others.

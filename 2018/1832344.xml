<AbstractNarration>The 16th International Conference on Nanochannels, Microchannels and Minichannels (ICNMM) to take place in Dubrovnik, Croatia June 10-13, 2018, is intended to provide a platform for researchers to exchange information and identify research needs in this emerging area encompassing many engineering, basic sciences, and bio-medical disciplines. Both fundamental aspects including transport studies at the nano, micro, and mini scales as well as practical applications including thermal management, energy conversion, lab on a chip, and biomedical devices are included. The insights obtained from the close interaction allowed by this conference will pave the way for the implementation of novel methods for transport physics in a range of applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ICNMM conference is one of the premier annual events for researchers in fields related to transport&lt;br/&gt;phenomena. The conference (1) advances the fundamental understanding of transport physics; and (2)&lt;br/&gt;discusses the fundamental physics related to modern electronic devices, biomedical, and energy&lt;br/&gt;applications. In particular, the plenary speakers for this conference represent a broad spectrum of fields including two-phase transport physics, transport phenomenal in micro and nanofluidic systems, and electrokinetic systems. The conference also includes nine confirmed Keynote presentations, covering a broad variety of disciplines and institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

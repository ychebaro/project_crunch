<AbstractNarration>Environmental assessment and ecosystem-level research requires advanced analytical capabilities. This acquisition of a gas chromatograph with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer will provide a previously unavailable instrument to South Texas scientists studying biogeochemical cycling and environmental contaminants. This instrument has the ability to detect and quantify thousands of compounds, including anthropogenic contaminants, that can then be studied in greater detail to assess their metabolic role or influence on ecosystems. These areas of research are vital, not only to the rapidly developing and industrialized South Texas region but throughout the northern Gulf of Mexico. Additionally, with much of this region experiencing regular extreme weather events and environmental change, this instrument will play a role in understanding how our ecosystems are adapting to this shifting reality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This instrument has capabilities that will enable a broad range of research for the faculty at Texas A&amp;M University Corpus-Christi, but also other Hispanic Serving Institutions in our region. Some of the potential areas of research enabled by this instrument include: assessing the fate, transport and ecosystem effects of industrial and agricultural contaminants; determination of bacterial metabolites in freshwater and marine sediment; analysis of amino acids in sediment organic matter and biological matrixes; determination of natural organic matter biomarkers; analysis of atmospheric dissolved organic nitrogen. These studies will encompass basic and applied research that seeks to examine natural scientific processes and the ways in which humans are influencing our world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

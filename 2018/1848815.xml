<AbstractNarration>This award will provide support for participants to attend "Deep Learning for Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (MMA): Real-Time Discovery at Scale", a three-day workshop that will be held October 17-19, 2018 at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The purpose of the workshop is to catalyze the creation of a community whose expertise is at the interface of two of NSF's 10 Big Ideas: Harnessing the Data Revolution and Windows on the Universe. Domain experts attending this event will inform the design of a roadmap of future collaborations to accelerate convergence between these two disparate frontiers of science and technology to fully realize MMA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

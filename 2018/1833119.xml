<AbstractNarration>This CAREER project identifies solutions for improving the reuse of open&lt;br/&gt;data and assesses the demand for open government data. The research&lt;br/&gt;project models the open data user experience to clarify assumptions about&lt;br/&gt;who uses open data, what they find relevant, and their level of data&lt;br/&gt;literacy. Assessment tools are essential for evaluating open data&lt;br/&gt;investments. Years of congressional legislation and administrative&lt;br/&gt;projects have created a steady supply of spreadsheets, transaction logs,&lt;br/&gt;semi-structured documents, and other digital files released as open data.&lt;br/&gt;As public life increasingly depends on inferences made from data, an&lt;br/&gt;investigation into data literacy supports NSF's mission to advance&lt;br/&gt;national health, prosperity, and welfare. The findings in an open&lt;br/&gt;government context promote the progress of science and may be generalized&lt;br/&gt;to open research and open science projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project examines the flow of open data from suppliers to consumers in&lt;br/&gt;a data supply chain. Three empirical studies reflect open government data&lt;br/&gt;projects at different stages of maturity. The studies demonstrate&lt;br/&gt;relationships between digital material and data science practice.&lt;br/&gt;Inductive social science inquiry and ethnographically-informed deductive&lt;br/&gt;research validate the findings. The empirical evidence closes a gap in&lt;br/&gt;knowledge about data reuse and advances theory in the emerging field of&lt;br/&gt;data usability. Outreach activities are designed to include professionals&lt;br/&gt;who may not be educated in Science, Technology, Engineering or Math (STEM)&lt;br/&gt;but who could make valuable contributions to data-driven projects. The&lt;br/&gt;education plan is devoted to advancing data literacy in the classroom and&lt;br/&gt;in the workforce. The interdisciplinary foundations of this project are&lt;br/&gt;part of a broader conversation on the integrity of data science practices.</AbstractNarration>

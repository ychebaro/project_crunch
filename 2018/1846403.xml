<AbstractNarration>Emerging infectious diseases are a global concern. Disease outbreaks can be devastating for host populations, but also provide an opportunity to address gaps in our knowledge about how diseases work. For example, we need to better understand how outbreaks subside. Researchers hypothesize that host defenses (i.e., host immunity) influence pathogen infection patterns and reduce the long-term impacts of a disease. However, it is challenging to pinpoint the specific host defenses that reduce disease severity in natural populations. This project will test the hypothesis that host defenses alter infection patterns in a disease known as chytridiomycosis. Chytridiomycosis is a deadly fungal disease that impacts frogs, toads, salamanders, and other amphibians. This disease has caused - and continues to cause - dramatic losses of amphibian biodiversity around the world. The investigators will determine how skin secretions, an amphibian defense with anti-fungal properties, affect the severity and duration of chytridiomycosis outbreaks. This research will contribute to society by informing strategies to protect amphibian biodiversity. It will also advance scientific knowledge of emerging infectious diseases like chytridiomycosis. Finally, the project will broaden participation through training and research engagement for young women in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will combine cutting-edge experiments with field studies on host defense mechanisms in three species of amphibians. The research team will determine the role of skin secretions in host defense using immunosuppression treatments and pathogen-exposure experiments. The team will also use field and common-garden experiments to quantify how skin secretion defenses vary across populations, elevations, and seasons. In addition, the project will implement a "20 in 2020" program that will launch 20 young women in their pursuit of higher education in scientific fields. The educational plan includes engagement in the scientific research project; preparation for university coursework; and a tiered mentoring network to support high school, undergraduate, and graduate students. The education and outreach activities will be an integral part of the proposed project, helping to increase awareness of the potential of young women in science, the loss of amphibian biodiversity, and the importance of advancing our understanding of infectious disease.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

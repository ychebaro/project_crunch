<AbstractNarration>The Third Workshop on Higher-Order Asymptotics and Post-Selection Inference (WHOA-PSI) will be held on the campus of Washington University in St. Louis from September 8-10, 2018.  Post-selection inference refers to the question of valid statistical inference performed after a model selection procedure has been utilized. Higher-order asymptotics provide the tools and insights needed to refine basic large-sample results for post-selection inference procedures and make them more accurate and powerful, even when the scientist only has access to small to moderate sample sizes. WHOA-PSI seeks to merge these fields, foster collaboration and discussion, and push forward the post-selection inference research frontier in the direction of higher-order accuracy and more powerful inference procedures. NSF funding will support junior researchers attending this conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop attempts to address the needs of applied statisticians utilizing model selection procedures who also need extremely accurate and powerful inference procedures with theoretical guarantees. Topics from post-selection inference include selective inference after variable selection, high-dimensional and post-regularized inference, inference after change-point estimation, and simultaneous inference. Some talks will focus on methods from higher-order asymptotics, which can yield insights and improvements to post-selection inference procedures, including series expansions, saddlepoint approximations, and bootstrap-based refinements. Additional talks will present important applied problems for which new post-selection methods are needed. Examples include statistical genetics, neuroscience, and finance. (See http://www.math.wustl.edu/~kuffner/WHOA-PSI-3.html)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

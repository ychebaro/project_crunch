<AbstractNarration>Interconnection agreements between Internet Service Providers (ISPs), transit providers, and content delivery networks (CDNs) allow broadband users to transmit traffic to, and receive traffic from, everywhere on the Internet.  These agreements are based on a combination of technical issues (e.g. the locations to and from which the provider agrees to route traffic and the amount of traffic exchanged in each direction) and economic issues (e.g. the perceived value of the arrangement and any fees involved).  Historically, interconnection agreements consisted of settlement-free peering agreements (between network providers at the same tier) or paid transit agreements (between network providers of different tiers).  However, changes in Internet topology resulting from mergers between access and backbone networks and the proliferation of CDNs have resulted in most Internet traffic now flowing through interconnection points between access networks and CDNs.  These traffic flows are often subject to a new category of paid peering agreements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the past five years, disputes over interconnection agreements have occasionally led to failures to augment interconnection capacity, which in turn have harmed the experience of consumers.  This project will construct a modern model of Internet interconnection that incorporates both the relevant technical and economic factors.  The model will be used to explain and guide new forms of Internet interconnection arrangements.  The project will also develop methods to illustrate when Internet interconnection agreements may be used in anticompetitive and discriminatory manners.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project consists of two interrelated efforts.  In the development of models of Internet interconnection, the project will investigate the cost factors that should affect interconnection arrangements, including the destinations to which a network operator will route traffic, the volume of traffic, the network cost along that path, and any transit payments required.  The project will also investigate the value factors that may affect interconnection arrangements, including the destinations to which an interconnection partner will route traffic, the volume of traffic, and the value of that traffic based on the application.  The project will then analyze the variation of the feasible ranges of prices for paid peering with network costs, the maximum that a party is willing to pay, routing and traffic ratios, and competitive pressures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Second, in the development of analytical models of competitive versus anticompetitive behavior, the project will evaluate the characteristics of a variety of interconnection agreements, including the minimum number of interconnection points, routing requirements, capacity augmentation requirements, determinants of payment, and conditions for termination.  The project will examine the impact of interconnection prices on broadband providers, content providers, and Internet users, and the resulting impact upon engineering decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is expected to contribute substantially to the development of network modeling and analysis techniques that integrate technical and economic factors.  The expected outcomes of the project will lend insight into commercial interconnection arrangements, as well as into related public policy issues when disputes harm the experience of consumers.  The project will also contribute to informing policymakers and their staff about the technical aspects of telecommunication issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

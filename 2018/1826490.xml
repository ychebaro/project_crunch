<AbstractNarration>The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in their efforts to significantly increase the numbers of students matriculating into and successfully completing high quality degree programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines to diversify the STEM workforce.  Particular emphasis is placed on transforming undergraduate STEM education through innovative, evidence-based recruitment and retention strategies, and relevant educational experiences in support of racial and ethnic groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines: African Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders.  These strategies facilitate the production of well-prepared students highly-qualified and motivated to pursue graduate education or careers in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the United States (U.S.) to remain globally competitive, it is vital that it taps into the talent of all its citizens and provides exceptional educational preparedness in STEM areas that underpin the knowledge-based economy.  The California State University-Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (CSU-LSAMP) program was established in 1993 in response to the need for a more diverse and skilled technical workforce.  That need still exists and is particularly acute in the State of California.  CSU-LSAMP is an alliance of the 23 campuses of the California State University (CSU) system.  As a LSAMP STEM Pathways and Research Alliance, the project has two primary goals: (1) increase the number of underrepresented minority (URM) students graduating with undergraduate and graduate degrees in STEM, and (2) contribute to the production of scholarly research in broadening participation in STEM.  These goals support the National Science Foundation's strategic goal to "cultivate a world-class, broadly inclusive science and engineering workforce, and expand the scientific literacy of all citizens."  To achieve the first goal, CSU-LSAMP will provide activities that support the academic integration, professionalization, and social integration of participants.  Goal two will be achieved through the creation of a research team made up of social science researchers, program evaluators, and the CSU-LSAMP leadership team.  This research team will be the first step in creating a CSU center for broadening participation research, which will serve as a resource for education and social science researchers across the CSU system.  Research results will be broadly disseminated to ensure the replication of successful undergraduate intervention models that increase access to, and success in STEM baccalaureate degree programs and facilitate admissions to STEM graduate programs; and moreover, lead to a more talented and diverse STEM workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the Graduate Workshop in Algebraic Geometry for Women and Mathematicians of Minority Genders which will take place at MIT and Harvard University over the weekend of February 17-18, 2018.  The workshop will promote the professional community of women and researchers of minority genders in algebraic geometry and adjacent fields, focusing on the needs of young graduate students.  Participants will be exposed to the research of leading women algebraic geometers and will have the opportunity to interact with faculty and postdoc mentors and with each other.  Attending this conference will boost participants' feelings of 'knowing people' at other, non-gender-specific conferences, and therefore it will have lasting effects on the community beyond this workshop. More information can be found at the workshop website, https://sites.google.com/view/gwag. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants will gain insight into rapidly advancing topics in algebraic geometry through minicourses by invited speakers on Coleman integration on curves, conformal blocks vector bundles, moduli spaces of tropical and algebraic curves, and irrationality of higher-dimensional varieties.  Afternoon working groups will delve deeper into these topics by working through explicit examples and open-ended problems under the guidance of a mentor.</AbstractNarration>

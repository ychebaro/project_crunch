<AbstractNarration>In this project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamic &amp; Mechanism B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Mengyan Shen at University of Massachusetts Lowell (UML) is testing the hypothesis that chain hydrocarbons are quantum mechanically synthesized on a cobalt/cobalt oxide surface from carbon dioxide, water, and light.  This reaction mimics photosynthesis and is important in reducing carbon dioxide and increasing the energy supply.  The goals of this research are to exploit the characteristics of an unusual isotope distribution that is completely different from conventional expectation.  The project provides great opportunities for training students including those underrepresented in sciences.  It also helps to develop a workforce on quantum computing.  Outreach activities involving K-12 students will also be part of the funded project.  &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;A cobalt oxide photo-catalyst, discovered in Professor Shen's lab at UML, is physically activated by sunlight and has been proven to directly convert carbon dioxide and water to long-chain hydrocarbons (C5 to C15). When a mixture of isotopic C-12 and C-13 carbon dioxide was used, a highly unusual isotope distribution was observed.  Particular objectives of this proposal are (1) To confirm the observation that pure C-12 hydrocarbons and pure C-13 hydrocarbons tend to form easily on some catalysts' surfaces, which cannot be explained with the current chemical theories, (2) To understand and create a predictive model for the mechanism of the formation of chain hydrocarbons based on experimental results using isotopic carbon dioxide and isotopic water.  It is hoped that this would explain the observation of pure C-13 and pure C-12 having the tendency to group together in forming chain hydrocarbons, and (3) To find controlling parameters with light wavelength, temperature, and pressures as well as study the influence of the catalyst surface structures on the quantum formation of hydrocarbons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

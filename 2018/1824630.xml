<AbstractNarration>Reconstructing the locomotor behaviors of early human ancestors remains a central task in elucidating the origins of the hominin lineage. Because of its role in weight-bearing the heel bone (calcaneus), which has been relatively understudied, has great potential for illuminating the nature of both terrestrial and arboreal locomotion. The goal of this dissertation project is to determine how calcaneal external shape and internal structure vary with locomotor behaviors within and among humans and non-human great apes. Project findings will be used to provide context for interpreting fossil hominin calcanei, thus strengthening reconstructions of early hominin locomotion. This project will lead to a large database of surface and micro-CT scans that will be made available to the scientific community. It will also support the training of a female graduate student and undergraduates in quantitative techniques, and engage public and K-12 audiences in science outreach.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The calcaneus has a central role in weight bearing, foot inversion and contact with the substrate. Although previous studies have found differences in specific aspects of external shape and internal structure related to locomotor mode, this project will examine the entire external and internal morphology. The project will include quantification of calcaneal shape and trabecular structure in its entirety through a 3D geometric morphometric sliding semilandmark analysis and recently developed trabecular techniques. The student co-PI will analyze how calcaneal morphology varies with locomotor behavior, body size, and phylogeny and apply these findings to fossil hominins to increase our understanding of hominin use of arboreal behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

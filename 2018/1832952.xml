<AbstractNarration>The IEEE North American School for Information Theory is an annual event of the IEEE Information Theory Society. 2018 marks the eleventh year of the event. The School provides a supportive environment where foundations for learning and long-term future scientific collaborations are established. The School delivers interactive education for graduate students in the mathematical, engineering, and computer sciences. It presents students the opportunity to meet with and learn from senior researchers from academia and industry who present long-format tutorials. In addition, student and post-doc participants have the opportunity to present their own research results in poster sessions. The IEEE Information Theory Society Padovani Lecture is delivered at the school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IEEE North American School for Information Theory is hosted by different institutions each year, with the intent of increasing the geographic diversity of the participants. Student attendance at recent schools has varied from 40 to 80 student participants. Travel grants broaden the participation of students at the workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

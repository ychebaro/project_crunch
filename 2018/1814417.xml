<AbstractNarration>Emerging Non-Volatile Memories (NVMs) promise convergence of memory and storage into a single system that is both fast and persistent. Existing security functions for storage systems were designed for slower storage devices, which create a performance bottleneck for faster NVMs.  This research will investigate high performance security solutions for NVM based storage systems. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The first research thrust will focus on encrypting data for emerging NVMs. The second thrust investigates implementation of auditing mechanisms for NVM based storage systems.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will train graduate and undergraduate students on architecting secure systems. The results from this research will inform several undergraduate and graduate courses. Students from underrepresented groups will be encouraged to participate in this project. The results will be published in reputed conferences and journals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project data and results will be published and maintained in both private and public repositories. The project will use Github site: https://github.com/sacagroup/sacagroup.github.io. All project data, codes and results will be maintained for at least 5 years after the end of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

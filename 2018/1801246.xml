<AbstractNarration>The Great Plains Combinatorics Conference 2018 is planned to be held at Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, on the weekend of April 28-29, 2018. The conference covers various subfields of combinatorics, including algebraic combinatorics and graph theory. Combinatorics is an important area of mathematics. It is closely related to other areas of mathematics and has applications to other sciences, including computer science, biology, and physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Great Plains Combinatorics Conferences is a regional conference series in combinatorics that has been held in 2014 and 2016 at the University of Kansas. Many research universities in the western Great Plains have small groups (often just one or two faculty members) working in combinatorics, and the low concentration of universities means that combinatorialists are somewhat geographically isolated from each other. Accordingly, the Great Plains Combinatorics Conference (GPCC) was started in 2014 to bring together combinatorialists from the region, modeled after other successful regional conferences such as CombinaTexas and KUMUNU. The meetings are held over a weekend, with most participants arriving on Friday evening. There are usually 4 plenary talks on Saturday, plus a graduate students poster session, and 3 plenary talks on Sunday.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>A request is made to fund Oceanographic Instrumentation for the R/V Roger Revelle, a 273? general purpose, Global vessel. The vessel is operated by Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet.  R/V Roger Revelle is owned by the Navy and supports multidisciplinary oceanographic research in all of the world?s ocean basins. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2017, REVELLE completed 282 days, 87 (31%) of which were for NSF. In 2018, she is currently scheduled with 243 days, 146 (60%) of which are for NSF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The prioritized Instrumentation request includes the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Seismic Streamer System $1,010,041&lt;br/&gt;2) REVELLE Networking Hardware $220,642&lt;br/&gt;3) REVELLE Computer Racks $37,884&lt;br/&gt;4) Seismic Source Cabling $35,544&lt;br/&gt;5) REVELLE -80 Freezers $15,420&lt;br/&gt;6) REVELLE/RIDE Mooring Release/Modem $57,480&lt;br/&gt;       $1,377,011&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts       &lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

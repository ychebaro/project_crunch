<AbstractNarration>The newest generation of polar-focused researchers will need a strong understanding of interdisciplinary approaches to understand the rapid changes in polar regions. The Next Generation Polar Research Conference (NGPR-3) is designed to train and help network early career polar researchers to position them for interdisciplinary research careers. This week-long symposium, to be held at the University of Southern California's Wrigley Marine Science Center, will provide an important opportunity for newer polar scientists to understand the benefits of interdisciplinary research approaches that can better inform society and stakeholders and to learn more about safe and effective logistics for research in polar regions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thirty four early career scientists (i.e., within 5 years of Ph.D.) from the fields of atmospheric science, marine ecosystems, limnology, ice science, terrestrial ecosystems, geospace, and policy and economics will be competitively selected to attend the conference. The symposium will be designed to foster communication, team-building and leadership skills with a focus on the development of interdisciplinary research. Participants will gain important networking opportunities while attending plenary talks, special sessions, poster sessions and professional development training led by senior mentors from the research subfields of social sciences, natural sciences and physical sciences. The workshop contributes to NSF's strategic objectives to foster the growth of a more capable and diverse research workforce and advance the scientific and innovation skills of the Nation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>This project will explore ways to increase bandwidth to the brain though optimal spatial-temporal simulation of the far peripheral retina.  There are many questions related to the functionality of the far periphery and how it engenders of a sense of place and presence within a virtual environment.  To address these questions this project will develop: (1) a state-of-the-art retinal image projection system that can generate and position spatial patterns of light encompassing the complete retina; (2) methods for measuring the effect of that stimulation on the brain wave activity, balance and task performance; and (3) new approaches for organizing and portraying information over the complete retina that increase throughput of data to the brain. The research from this project can lead to development of better virtual reality components that unlock the power of human intelligence and link minds globally. This line of research is essential as the industry presses for optimizing the utility of 5G cellular bandwidths in servicing wireless and ubiquitous virtual and augmented displays via WebVR and related systems.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate how to input the autonomic nervous system to enhance the cognitive behavior of users. A key component in the research agenda is to design and build an experimental system that generates and positions patterns of light stimuli onto the various regions and eccentricities of the entire visual field of the participant.  This system must allow for the precise generation of the spatial, temporal and spectral properties of these stimuli.  These factors constitute the independent variables in the research.  Similarly, this research apparatus must also collect the voluntary and involuntary behavioral response of the participant to these stimuli using direct methods that include event-related cortical potentials, oculomotor behavior and involuntary movement of the body (e.g., posture platform).  Voluntary or performance-based tracking and manipulation of the virtual world experience will also be included in the experimental apparatus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

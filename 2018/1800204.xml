<AbstractNarration>This proposal requests funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the annual Spring Institute in Noncommutative Geometry and Operator Algebras (NCGOA) to be held at the University of Muenster in Germany from May 14 to 19, 2018. Additional information about the institute can be found on the website https://ivv5hpp.uni-muenster.de/u/wwinter/wwinter/NCGOA.html&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will feature several mini-courses and research talks involving a very active area in operator algebras, namely that of C*-algebras and dynamics. Recent breakthroughs in noncommutative dimension theory have led to the solution of several long-standing conjectures. Tremendous progress in understanding C*-dynamical systems has been made as a result, and many exciting concepts have been introduced in the theory of C*-algebras following ideas from von Neumann algebra theory. The present school/conference aims at fostering interactions and collaborations between these direction of operator algebras. The proposed speakers are world leaders of their fields. It is expected the conference will germinate new international based interactions between C*-algebras, dynamical systems and von Neumann algebras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

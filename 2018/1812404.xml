<AbstractNarration>Threats to scientific instruments and data that are accessible via the Internet are ubiquitous.  The SouthEast SciEntific Cybersecurity for University REsearch (SECURE) project helps protect the National Science Foundation's investments in scientific research while providing scientists with tools to safeguard intellectual property and ensure data integrity. The project team provides education, training, and selected cybersecurity services to NSF-funded researchers across the Southeast.  The team is multidisciplinary, comprised of cybersecurity experts (both research and practitioner), scientists, and experts in communication.  Team members are located in South Carolina, Alabama and Mississippi, with strong representation from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU).  This program raises investigators' awareness of their essential role in creating a secure and trustworthy cyberspace and offers concrete assistance in risk assessment, vulnerability testing, and mitigation tailored to NSF-funded scientists' workflow and program size.  Through past collaborations, the team is well positioned to leverage both national and regional cybersecurity organizations and programs to effectively reach the target audience.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;SouthEast SECURE impacts the region by raising cybersecurity awareness; providing concise training, assessment, tools and one-on-one help; and assisting in preparation of select cybersecurity metrics.  Student interns are conducting many of these activities by means of practicum-based deployment and support, thus developing capabilities in the next generation of cyber professionals.  An online survey of NSF-funded investigators in the region will be conducted to learn about their primary cybersecurity challenges and concerns.  Training is then tailored to provide concrete and practical assistance in how to do right-sized risk assessment and mitigation.  A "toolkit" is provided to test and validate local cybersecurity, and measures of cybersecurity are created and field-tested.  The team's approach facilitates communication between research faculty and university IT/Data Security staff.  A long-term goal is building communities with common interests in cybersecurity and a commitment to helping others; and building connections with other regions and with national centers and programs.</AbstractNarration>

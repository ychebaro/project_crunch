<AbstractNarration>Genome engineering and editing technologies using CRISPR-Cas9 and other programmable nucleases are rapidly entering mainstream molecular biology research.  The emergence of these technologies presents a significant challenge to biological science instructors to provide engaging and effective ways to introduce these technologies into their classrooms. This workshop aims at introducing CRISPR-Cas9 technology to instructors in the context of information flow and the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology, allowing integration of these new technologies into the biological sciences framework. Workshop participants will develop hands-on skills for designing and using genome engineering and editing, and methods for incorporating these technologies into classroom discussions at their institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a 3-day workshop from June 16-18, 2018 at The Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio on the development and implementation of CRISPR-Cas9 technology for undergraduate instructors from different types of institutions as a prelude to the Association of Biology Laboratory Educators (ABLE). Faculty will be recruited from all types of undergraduate institutions, including minority-serving institutions and two-year institutions. Faculty participants will work together to (a) become conversant with background knowledge and lab skills relating to CRISPR-Cas9 technology, (b) bring different aspects of the technology into their classrooms/labs, (c) discuss and create pedagogical modules suitable to different types of classrooms/labs, and (d) foster and provide support to undergraduate educators who will disseminate gene engineering/editing technologies and make innovations in their classrooms/labs. Specifically, the meeting will encourage the teaching of CRISPR-Cas9 technologies to undergraduates in the context of biological information flow and the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology.  Dissemination plans include posting workshop materials on CURE net (https://curenet.cnsutexas.edu), a repository of course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

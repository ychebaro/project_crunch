<AbstractNarration>Language and cognition are deeply related, influencing each other in both universal and language-specific ways. This dissertation project aims to examine the relationship between the cognitive object/substance distinction and the linguistic count/mass distinction. More specifically, this project investigates how English, Korean and Mandarin Chinese speakers use and interpret count vs. mass nouns in their native languages and how Korean-speaking and Mandarin-speaking learners of English as a second language use and interpret count and mass nouns in English. This project aims to provide insights into what is universal and what is language-specific in the domain of the count/mass distinction. This project also has the potential to inform educators, language teaching professionals and developers of language teaching software about learners' use of the count/mass distinction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To meet its goals, this dissertation research will first investigate the relationship between the object/substance interpretation and the grammar of the count/mass distinction in English, Korean and Mandarin. Once the properties of the count/mass distinction in all three languages are established, this research will examine how Korean-speaking and Mandarin-speaking learners of English interpret different types of English nouns, as well as how they judge and process English plural marking (a marker of the count/mass distinction), in both offline and online (reaction-time) tasks. This project will contribute to the fields of theoretical linguistics and psycholinguistics by providing information on grammatical knowledge and processing in both native and non-native language. Furthermore, this project enhances the understanding of the grammars of East Asian languages, specifically Korean and Mandarin Chinese.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

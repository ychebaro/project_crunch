<AbstractNarration>Caching is a promising technology that is revolutionizing traditional data communication networks from host-based to information-centric architectures. In information centric networks, the focal point is content rather than where it can be retrieved; hence, one can replicate and store (or cache) content at various nodes or storage units throughout the network so that it can be accessed faster locally without burdening the server and the global network. This is desirable in Internet of Things (IoT) applications where content is distributed, and delay is of crucial importance. However, there are stringent constraints on device storage capabilities and computational power. As such, the existing caching mechanisms do not suit IoT domains very well. This project combines two main aspects of caching, namely, information theory and networking, to develop practical and timely coded caching schemes for dynamic and volatile networks such as the IoT. This will allow information-centric networks to achieve their full potential as a replacement to conventional host-based data communication networks of today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop practical and efficient caching and coding schemes for dynamic and volatile networks such as the IoT. It develops a new framework to model capabilities of users in caching content on the fly. This framework allows one to address practical constraints (such as storage capacities and freshness of information) by bringing concepts such as Age of Information (AoI) and cache replacement techniques from network theory and queuing theory into picture while preserving coding opportunities and optimality of the schemes (in an information theoretic sense).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>Cyber warfare has become a major threat to national security, and the increasing sophistication of cyber attacks calls for innovative analytical and automation capabilities to face advanced, persistent, and evolving adversaries.  The Center for Cybersecurity Analytics and Automation (CCAA) will develop a range of such new capabilities through a collaborative and multidisciplinary approach involving three university sites and a broad range of industry and government sponsors.  At the core of the Center's strategy is the goal to advance the state of art in sense-making, decision making, and resilience in order to enable systems to sustain cyber missions against sophisticated attacks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CCAA brings together experts in cybersecurity, formal modeling, and data-driven analytics to advance cyber defense on multiple fronts, namely, (a) robust and scalable sense-making for dynamic and predictive cyber analytics using large-scale heterogeneous cyber artifacts, (b) adaptive and autonomic decision-making for creating defense strategies and courses of action that are provably correct and operationally safe using mission requirements, security policies, guidelines, and system configurations, and (c) making resilience and agility inherent properties of cyber and cyber physical systems to enable real-time deterrence, deception, and mitigation.  The George Mason University site will provide expertise in attack modeling, software security, and stochastic optimization. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center's research will advance the state of the art in cyber defense against the most sophisticated threats.  Through an increased focus on technology transfer, CCAA will enable organizations to deploy new tools and analytical capabilities to effectively and efficiently secure their systems against advanced threats capable of circumventing traditional defenses.  Students at all levels will be actively involved in the research and will have ample opportunities to engage with industry sponsors and other university sites trough internships and extended cross-site visits.  Participation of undergraduate and high school students, female students, and underrepresented minorities will also be actively promoted.  &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The Center will create and maintain a center-wide repository to make research products such as datasets, code, tools, experimental results, and draft manuscripts available to all of the Center's members.  The repository will be accessible through the Center's website (http://www.ccaa-nsf.org/ ).  Consistent with the Center's bylaws and with any applicable requirements of individual universities or NSF, several of these products will be made available to the broader research and industry communities.  The repository will be actively maintained during the entire duration of the Phase II effort, and it will remain online beyond the end of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for participation in the conference "Between Topology and Quantum Field Theory" in Austin, TX, on January 14-18, 2019. The conference is intended to be a gathering of 100-150 researchers, including graduate students, postdocs, and faculty, in mathematics and theoretical physics. It will be an opportunity for broader communities of researchers to learn about dramatic developments from the last few years as well as about the areas of the conference more broadly. To maximize its impact the conference will be broadly advertised, and funds will be provided to support travel expenses of participants who otherwise could not attend. Researchers from groups underrepresented in mathematics and theoretical physics will be prioritized in allocating these funds. To further increase the reach of the conference, audio and video from the talks will be recorded and made freely available online.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will catalyze new interactions between researchers in fields bridging mathematics and physics. The specific focus will be on three overlapping areas: topological phenomena in quantum field theory, mathematical formulations of quantum field theory, and differential geometry of supersymmetry. The conference plan builds on significant recent momentum in these three areas, and includes a list of 18 confirmed speakers, including both current international leaders in these areas and up-and-coming future leaders. The conference web page is available at https://web.ma.utexas.edu/topqft/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>This project establishes an I-Corps Site at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) through its Innovation and Entrepreneurship Center at the Foisie Innovation Center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The I-Corps Site at WPI trains students and faculty in the value proposition and customer segments analysis of the Business Model Canvas as originated by Osterwalder. The I-Corps Site impacts campus-wide stakeholders, adding value to WPI's project-based education. The I-Corps Site at WPI provides the necessary infrastructure, resources, and training to enable groups (teams) to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Teams applicants. Under the leadership of WPI's President, Innovation and Entrepreneurship has been identified as one of the critical six pillars of WPI's vision and strategy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>Gamma-rays are the highest energy form of electromagnetic radiation. Observations of astrophysical gamma-rays serve as probes of physical conditions and processes in the most extreme environments throughout the Universe and can be used to test fundamental physics. The High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) observatory, located on the slopes of the Sierra Negra in Mexico, is a ground-based facility designed with unique capabilities to observe very high energy gamma-rays.  With its large instantaneous field of view and continuous operations HAWC surveys two-thirds of the sky every day.  HAWC observations have provided new views of the high energy sky and led to the discovery of new sources.  This award to the University of Maryland College Park supports the continued operation of HAWC.  This award will also support HAWC's public outreach programs that include outreach to the Hispanic-American community with bi-lingual products related to HAWC. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HAWC will continue to perform deep surveys of the gamma-ray sky and will observe a large sample of gamma-ray sources with measurements of flux, spectra and variability. HAWC's wide field and high sensitivity enable studies of extended sources and diffuse emission from the Galactic plane.  HAWC plays an important role in multi-wavelength and multi-messenger astrophysics campaigns.  The University of Maryland plays a critical role in HAWC operations.  The PI serves as U.S. Spokesperson for HAWC and the Co-PI serves as HAWC Data Manager.  With this award they will continue to operate and maintain the HAWC observatory, maintain the US data archive, and provide public data access to sky maps and real-time transient alerts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

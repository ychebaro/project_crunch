<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. To make STEM learning purposeful and fulfilling, this HBCU-UP TIP project aims to provide STEM juniors and seniors at Tuskegee University with experiences that are aligned with industry practices through a new and novel Makers Course and associated Makers Laboratory (MC&amp;ML) called "Conducting Integrative STEM Research in a Makerspace". The MC&amp;ML is designed to provide students with industry-like experiences needed STEM workforce readiness or graduate school preparation.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The novelty of the MC&amp;ML lies in its framework of the "Makerspace", a dedicated physical area where students from different STEM disciplines will convene for work on collaborative hands-on research projects in advanced multidisciplinary fields such as nanocomposites, biomaterials, smart materials, and computation modeling. The program interventions include: (1) the establishment of the MC&amp;ML, (2) the use of "Learning through lectures and making" whereby teams of multidisciplinary faculty will lecture, mentor students and supervise projects on dedicated MSE-focused topics, (3) increased summer research internships opportunities, (4) Graduate Record Examination (GRE) preparation, and (5) Workshops for the Graduate Research Fellowship Programs and STEM-Related Workforce. As an HBCU, Tuskegee is a leader in educating and preparing minority students for STEM careers. The success of the MC&amp;ML will contribute to increasing diversity in the STEM technology workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

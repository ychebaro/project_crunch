<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Delaware State University seeks to strengthen the university's ability to recruit, retain, and graduate underrepresented students in STEM by strengthening the forensic biology program and achieving accreditation by the Forensic Science Education Program Accreditation Commission. Outreach activities to high school students and community members are part of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has the objectives to: grow the number of students enrolled in and graduating from the forensic biology program; improve the placement rates of graduating seniors into STEM graduate programs or the STEM workforce; and increase the number of criminal justice majors who choose a forensic science minor. This project will revise and upgrade the forensic biology courses and curriculum, increase collaborative efforts with forensic science laboratories and professional organizations at the local, state, and federal level, and develop sustainable internship and mentoring programs to improve student retention and placement into graduate programs and careers post-graduation. The evaluation plan includes a study, that is both qualitative and quantitative, on the trajectories of students majoring in forensic biology and those minoring in forensic science, to identify hurdles that students face during degree completion, and, to put structures in place to address them, thereby improving retention, and degree completion rates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

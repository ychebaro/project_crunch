<AbstractNarration>The research will seek to improve understanding of aerosol's impacts on climate change and air pollution; this has implications for health as well as societal impacts. In addition, a variety of education, field experiment and research opportunities will be available for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) undergraduate students as after class research experiences. The project also provides support and training for a HBCU graduate student and a postdoctoral fellow. Moreover, there will be plenty of opportunities to introduce aerosol radiative forcing and remote sensing as real examples in undergraduate and graduate geoscience courses to help students to improve their research techniques and develop their theses and dissertation topics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aerosols have cooling effect on climate system through reflecting solar radiation. At the same time, some aerosols e.g. black carbon, can absorb solar radiation, which cools the surface but warms the atmosphere in the process. These effects of aerosols on radiation, the temperature profile, along with the role of aerosols as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), impact the radiative balance through the direct radiative effects of aerosols and indirect radiative effects on cloud properties and precipitation. To estimate aerosol effects on radiative forcing, knowing information about vertical distribution of aerosols is crucial since the vertical distribution of aerosols has a significant effect on the sign of radiative forcing. This research will develop a new aerosol vertical distribution retrieval algorithm which can take advantage of broad ceilometer networks on aerosol vertical distribution observations. Then the variability of aerosol vertical distributions and the impacts on radiative forcing and heating rate profile will be investigated. The investigated climate regions include areas of rural, suburban-urban, urban, urban-dust and ocean areas from mid-latitude to tropics. This research will investigate three scientific questions: (1) What are the characteristics of aerosol vertical distributions at different regions and seasons? (2) what are impacts of the aerosol vertical distribution on radiative forcing? and (3) what are the characteristics of heating rate profile associated with aerosols at different regions and seasons?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aerosols direct and indirect effects on radiative forcing is still one of the largest uncertainties in global climate models (IPCC, 2013) and the uncertainty in the aerosol vertical distribution alone can contribute as much half of the uncertainties of the global aerosols direct effect. The information of aerosol vertical distribution is needed to quantify the effects of aerosols on radiative forcing and how these in turn influence climate and the hydrological cycle. This study will enhance our understanding of aerosol vertical distributions though a new retrieval algorithm. It will improve the study of aerosol direct effects on radiative forcing as well as the indirect effects due to aerosol-cloud-precipitation interaction. It will aid to improve aerosol parameterizations and then improve air quality prediction, weather forecast and climate models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

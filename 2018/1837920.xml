<AbstractNarration>Work-life demands are a critical barrier to the career advancement, inclusion, and retention of women and minority faculty and research scientists; yet implementation gaps have received less scientific attention than other equality areas. Although some research has been conducted on these issues in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) departments, little knowledge has transferred over to professional schools and other disciplines, which play a key role in economic growth, such as in "big data" and entrepreneurial jobs. Addressing these gaps, this workshop will gather interdisciplinary experts to discuss the state of organizational science regarding gender equality, career success, and work-life inclusion in business schools and understudied contexts. The results of the workshop will help advance gender diversity, and women?s and minorities' career success in universities, business, and society by identifying scientific gaps, prioritizing studies; and addressing an under-researched critical area of organizational science. The research agenda developed will encourage future interdisciplinary scholarship on gender equality and work-life inclusion that can help policymakers to engage in evidence-based practices. New insights will be fostered on the organizational science regarding how to foster more gender and work-life inclusive businesses and universities and will advance scientific knowledge on strategies enhancing the attraction, advancement, retention, and career longevity of women faculty; and addressing societal inequality. The workshop products include a website and publications that will be disseminated to the public and policymakers. This workshop addresses a critical national policy area related to increasing labor market equality for women and minorities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite growing scientific attention to advancing women and minorities in universities generally, and in professional schools specifically, the gender and related work-life inclusion picture remains bleak. Addressing gender inequality requires greater dual scientific inquiry into the science of organizations involving the more effective implementation of formal work-life policies such as extending the tenure clock or dual career hire incentives, and the creation of "work-life inclusive climates." A work-life inclusive climate is defined as one where a faculty member would not feel s/he would have to sacrifice their family and non-work identities in order to succeed in the job role. The goals of this interdisciplinary workshop is (1) to assess work-life and career issues and linkages to faculty gender inclusion and diversity in business schools and understudied contexts from an organizational science perspective; (2) to define the scientific terrain of faculty gender and work-life inclusion and intersectionality linkages; (3) to increase knowledge of the science of fostering gender, work-life inclusion, career success and organizational change in understudied faculty contexts; and (4) to foster interdisciplinary conversation with thought leaders, researchers and exemplary key decision-makers in order to identify scientific antecedents, outcomes and future research gaps. The results of the workshop will be widely distributed to inform the public, researchers, university decision-makers, and policymakers including a workshop website with thought paper abstracts and a workshop report; national presentations, an open-access peer-reviewed publication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

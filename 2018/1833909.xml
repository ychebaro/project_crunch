<AbstractNarration>Nanotechnology is enhancing the performance of or adding new properties to materials used in diverse areas like agriculture, medicine, energy, consumer products, environmental technologies, automotive products, and even the film industry. Sustainable nanotechnology attempts to ensure that novel industrial operations and products are sustainable in terms of their environmental, societal and economic dimensions. The current scenario now for most nanotechnology applications is not sustainable due to the use of large amounts of non-renewable raw materials and energy, as well as the production of by-products potentially toxic for humans and the environment.  The 7th Sustainable Nanotechnology Conference will bring together academicians, researchers, governmental workers, policy makers and industrial employees to discuss and gain a better understanding of best practices and approaches to develop sustainable nanotechnology. It is expected that a wide range of experts, including materials scientists, industrial partners, students, government officials, social and physical scientists, toxicologists, and engineers will attend this conference. The funds requested will support travel expenses for about 20 research students including females, minorities, and those from underrepresented groups to work in sustainable nanotechnology. Hence, the conference will provide networking and educational opportunities for young scientists at various career stages. In addition, funding will be used for an award to an emerging investigator, travel support to plenary speakers, and some general conference expenses. We expect that participants from all over the world will attend and ensure a knowledgeable group to facilitate up to date presentations and inspiring discussions and the promotion of nanotechnology related to sustainable systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests funds to support the seventh annual conference of the "Sustainable Nanotechnology Organization" (SNO) to be held from November 8-10, 2018 in Alexandria, Virginia (Washington DC).  Such a conference has as its goal the bringing together of researchers in order to discuss the latest findings in the field of sustainable nanotechnology and to form collaborations which promote synergy in the research. Current sustainable nanotechnology attempts to ensure that novel industrial development is sustainable in terms of environmental, societal and economic dimensions. &lt;br/&gt;This conference is unique since it is the only one focused toward cutting edge nanotechnology and how it relates to sustainability across disciplines involved in the development of new knowledge in the field. The goal of the conference is to promote open-dialogue on the sustainable implications and applications of nanotechnology. This specialized conference on sustainable nanotechnology, involving the best intellects in this area, will enable a more responsible approach to the development of nanotechnology by instilling the importance of sustainability in the initial research, in addition to the end products. The conference will benefit scientists by identifying sustainable research goals that will yield necessary information to allow policy makers and manufacturers to define a path forward using accumulated data. This will result in improved risk assessment and management strategies and yield helpful information for developed or developing companies in the manufacturing of nanomaterials and nanotechnology products that improve sustainability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>This award is co-funded by the Systems and Synthetic Biology Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Engineering Biology Research Consortium, or EBRC, aims to be the leading organization bringing together an inclusive community committed to advancing synthetic biology to address national and global needs. Synthetic biology encompasses an important set of tools and technologies to continue to build and strengthen the national bio-economy. EBRC supports and promotes the vision and goals of the United State synthetic biology community by providing the future vision for synthetic biology, bringing together industrial and research communities, catalyzing leading-edge research and education programs. In addition, EBRC is establishing training resources for synthetic biologists, and promoting and engaging in dialogue about synthetic biology among policy makers and other members of the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports the development of a national-scale research roadmap for the field of synthetic biology in the United States to ensure the nation's continued international leadership in this critical area. Working with a diverse group of leading academic and industrial scientists from across the country, EBRC is developing and publishing a roadmap for the continued advancement of the field of engineering biology, with a focus on technical developments over the next decade. The project also addresses non-technical needs such as education and training, that are required to continue to advance the scientific field  and ensure the nation's leadership.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

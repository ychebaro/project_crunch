<AbstractNarration>The 22nd Quantum Information Processing Workshop (QIP 2019) will be co-hosted by the University of Colorado, Boulder (UC Boulder) and the Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics (JILA) on January 12-18, 2019. This workshop is the central event in the area of Quantum Computing and, more generally, Quantum Information Science, bringing together over 500 of the leading researchers in theoretical aspects of quantum information and computation, and play a role as one of the most important venues for the groundbreaking research in theoretical computer science. Students attending this event receive a broad exposure to the most novel and exciting ideas and results in the field by contributed talks, poster sessions, rump sessions, tutorial sessions, and industry sessions.  In addition, participation in this top conference is an excellent opportunity for young researchers to develop necessary research skills in presentation and collaborations. By enabling the attendance of students with financial difficulty and encouraging the diversity of the participants, this travel grant potentially has long-term benefits after QIP 2019 has concluded.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project funds the participation of US-based students in this event. Participation at this meeting will enhance the research experiences for students and provide increased opportunities for new collaborations. NSF support will help broaden participation at the QIP Workshop by subsidizing the travel for up to 16 student participants. Organizers aim at increasing the number of student and postdoctoral participants by targeting women, undergraduates, and under-represented groups for participation. The aim is to support young researchers who might not otherwise be able to attend QIP 2019 due to financial difficulty as well as to encourage the diversity of the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

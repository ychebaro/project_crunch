<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project lies in helping more amputees walk safely with less effort. There are approximately 800,000 individuals living with a major lower limb amputation, and this number is growing largely due to diabetes. For 50,000 amputees each year who need a new prosthetic knee, two options exist:  learn to use a traditional prosthetic knee or attempt to obtain a high-tech, computer-controlled knee. The former require the amputee learn and execute specific technique(s) to walk safely, while the latter do so automatically but cost $30,000 to $100,000 and require physical qualification, greatly limiting their availability. The novel prosthetic knee developed here offers stability automatically, regardless of amputee technique. It prevents buckling while simultaneously allowing the user to walk safely with whatever leg motions the user is able to generate. Since it requires no electronics or power, it is available to all amputees regardless of ability, and at a fraction of the cost of high-tech knees. Amputees will be able to walk farther with less effort, improving health and quality of life, and easing caregiver burden. Additionally, this design could be adapted for use in orthotic, robotic or exoskeletal systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop and test a novel prosthetic knee. Funding would be used to build prototypes and conduct mechanical, analytical and destructive testing. This testing is necessary to demonstrate that the design is feasible, safe for humans, and deserving of further development with amputees. An independent engineering design review will be obtained, prototypes will then be bench tested for function in a biomechanics lab, and an independent lab will provide destructive testing to prove ultimate strength of the device for comparison against known standards. The anticipated technical results include proof that the device can support the weight of a 300lb person, and quantitative evidence that the device will afford intuitive and universally available stability to amputees through its innovative swing- and stance-phase functionality. This work would advance the knowledge of prosthetics, rehabilitation and bipedal locomotion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

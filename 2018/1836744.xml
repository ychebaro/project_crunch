<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for participation in the conference "Current Progress in Mathematical Physics" to be held at Harvard University in Boston, MA over the course of four days during the week of December 10--17, 2018.  The conference will focus on recent developments in analysis, especially in the field of mathematical physics and quantum information science.  The goal of the meeting is to bring together a broad spectrum of mathematicians, physicists, and information scientists to cross-fertilize ongoing research, stimulate new collaborations, and discuss long-range research goals.  The interdisciplinary structure aims to interest students and researchers in potential new methods and to advance ideas that cross the boundaries of mathematics, physics, and quantum information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will feature presentations by leading researchers in mathematical physics and quantum information science.  One topical focus is a recently-discovered coincidence between representation theory and Riemannian geometry and its potential use in development of a consistent mathematical theory that embodies both quantum theory and relativity.  Other topics emphasized in the conference include geometrical concepts in quantum information theory and the development of an analytic point of view in topological quantum field theory.  This award gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, and researchers without other sources of support an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference.  More information will be made available at the conference webpage: http://www.arthurjaffe.com/Assets/pdf/HarvardWorkshop.pdf&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

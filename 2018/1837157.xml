<AbstractNarration>This award will support the participation of students, postdoctoral scientists, and early career faculty in the symposium titled "Multiscale Modeling of Soft Materials and Interfaces" that will be held as a part of the Materials Research Society Fall 2018 meeting in Boston, MA.  The symposium will focus on recent scientific advances in the theory and simulation of these materials, that encompass colloids, gels, foams, polymers, suspensions, and bioinspired materials.  These materials are critical to technologies that include drug delivery, energy storage devices, coatings, and oil recovery.  The symposium will include distinguished invited speakers from industry, academia, and national laboratories and contributed talks and posters by students and early career scientists.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference is timely in terms of the technical impact and translation to applications, due to recent advances in modeling methods and theory and recent rapid advances in high performance computing. The symposium will disseminate the latest advances in the field while simultaneously informing and recruiting the next generation of scientists and broadening the participation of under-represented groups in materials science research. Encouraging the participation of young investigators will help fill a national need to train a future work force in soft matter design and will provide a unique opportunity for young investigators to interact with leading researchers and industrial practitioners in this area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

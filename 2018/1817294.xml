<AbstractNarration>Free radicals are extremely reactive and unstable chemicals generated from various sources like biological metabolism and atmospheric reactions. Overproduction of free radicals, such as hydroxyl radicals, in a human body, is known as one of the causes for accelerated aging, cancer, Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. Therefore, a rapid and efficient detection of free radicals is essential for the prevention and cure of these diseases. Several methods have been used for the detection of free radicals; however, most of them are not accurate and consistent enough in identifying the type and concentration of free radicals. The goal of this proposal is to make a robust and reusable sensor for hydroxyl radicals. The sensor is regarded as greatly beneficial not only for medical diagnosis, but also for fuel cells, and environmental monitoring. This research will be performed by a diverse team with a strong interest in increasing the participation of underrepresented groups in science (including Ohio's rural communities, WISDOM, Latino Youth Summit, and EXCEL programs).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research investigates the electrochemical characteristics of hydroxyl radicals and the nano-composites including redox reaction mechanisms at the nanoscale, and the effects of catalyst and structure of the materials on the electron transfer rate and redox reaction mechanisms. Leveraging the PIs? experience in sensors and controlled synthesis of nanomaterials, this project seeks to achieve the following specific objectives: (1) investigate the influence of the type of substrate and the electrochemical catalyst on the redox reaction between cerium oxide and OH radicals, (2) investigate the effect of the composite composition on the affinity of cerium oxide toward hydroxyl radicals, (3) selectively deposit cerium oxide nano-islands onto supported metal nanoparticles for increased surface area, and (4) investigate the selectivity of the composites toward hydroxyl radicals from other radical types. This research has the potential to transform not only the sensors field, but also other research areas including free radical studies, nano-metal synthesis, composite materials synthesis, and material characterization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

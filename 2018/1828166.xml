<AbstractNarration>This award is to purchase a Dynamic Imaging Particle Analyzer (DIPA) for research and training associated with particles in water at Montclair State University (MSU). The DIPA is capable of accurately and rapidly counting and characterizing particles in water. It will serve as a core instrument for two MSU's existing research areas: 1) the development of innovative water treatment technologies for the removal of various water pollutants and 2) the identification and characterization of algae in natural freshwater. Furthermore, the DIPA will be used to open new research opportunities for MSU, including the measurement of storm water runoff particulates related to soil erosion and the development of emergency water treatment for natural disasters. The DIPA will be shared among MSU faculty, research staff, and students across different departments and programs. The instrument will also be used for educational and outreach purposes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Particulate matters (PMs), such as clays and algal cells, can significantly degrade the quality of engineered and natural water systems. Occasionally, PMs (e.g. flocs from coagulant addition) are intentionally produced for removing undesirable water contaminants (e.g. colloids). Accurate and rapid analyses of these PMs are key to the success of MSU's core research areas in water treatment and freshwater phytoplankton. The proposed DIPA will provide a real-time and non-invasive way to image, count, and characterize PMs in water. This instrument will enable new research opportunities for multiple programs at MSU, particularly environmental engineering, environmental science, ecology, biology, and chemistry. The instrument will also be used for the Passaic River Institute's public education on recreational water safety.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>The 16th annual Graduate Student Topology and Geometry Conference is to be held at The University of Illinois at Chicago on April 7-8, 2018. It is specifically aimed at graduate students, and many of the talks will be delivered by student participants. The conference will represent a large body of students in different stages of their Ph.D., and will provide a venue for students from a diverse collection of institutions and geographic regions to come together and interact. It aims to create a highly collaborative environment that will stimulate research and foster lasting connections between researchers at particularly crucial moments early in their careers. The conference will also provide a venue for students to hear about cutting edge research from established senior leaders and early career faculty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal goal for this conference is to give graduate students the opportunity to present their research. Particular attention will be paid to ensure that a broad collection of topics are represented, so that rising generations of mathematicians are aware of the current frontiers of geometry and topology. To this end, there will also be talks by distinguished plenary speakers Ian Agol (University of California, Berkeley), Natasa Sesum (Rutgers University), and Shmuel Weinberger (University of Chicago), and early career faculty speakers Justin Curry (University at Albany, SUNY), Priyam Patel (University of California, Santa Barbara), Andrew Sanders (Heidelberg University), Jenya Sapir (Binghamton University), and Caglar Uyanik (Vanderbilt University). These presentations will cover a range of topics in topology and geometry including topological data analysis, homotopy theory, low dimensional topology, geometric group theory, geometric analysis, geometric topology, and dynamics. The talks provide opportunities for early career researchers to personally engage with experts outside of their home university, expanding and consolidating the network of mathematical scientists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference website is: https://www.math.uic.edu/gstgc2018/</AbstractNarration>
